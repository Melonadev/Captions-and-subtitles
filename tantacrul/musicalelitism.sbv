MARTIN (narrating):
Let me start with a question:

0:00:04.150,0:00:06.490
How can we overcome elitism in music?

0:00:06.700,0:00:09.160
Well, let me show you one way that doesn’t work.

0:00:09.520,0:00:10.710
In September 2020,

0:00:10.710,0:00:13.140
...a Vox podcast called ‘Switched on Pop’

0:00:13.140,0:00:15.710
...released an episode about Beethoven’s 5th symphony.

0:00:15.710,0:00:16.910
To promote the podcast,

0:00:16.910,0:00:19.800
...the hosts also wrote an introductory article titled:

0:00:23.570,0:00:25.918
Here’s the thesis put forward in that article:

0:00:25.920,0:00:28.958
Before Beethoven, people clapped during performances.

0:00:28.960,0:00:31.150
Then Beethoven’s 5th symphony was premiered,

0:00:31.150,0:00:33.060
...which the authors claim required a

0:00:33.060,0:00:34.460
...‘new kind of listening’

0:00:34.460,0:00:36.210
...because it is a multi-movement work.

0:00:36.210,0:00:38.220
They then conclude that it's specifically

0:00:38.220,0:00:39.750
...this 'new kind of listening’

0:00:39.750,0:00:42.820
...that caused audiences to refrain
from clapping between movements,

0:00:42.820,0:00:46.570
...which in turn gave rise to an elitist
and exclusionary ‘polite society’

0:00:46.570,0:00:49.180
Now, apart from being a chronology drawn in crayon,

0:00:49.180,0:00:51.520
...this smoking gun presented in the article is

0:00:51.520,0:00:53.620
...oddly absent from the podcast itself,

0:00:53.620,0:00:57.160
...which really pulls its punches on
just about every aspect of this idea.

0:00:57.160,0:00:59.210
It turns out they don’t blame the 5th symphony

0:00:59.210,0:01:01.160
...or Beethoven for elitism at all.

0:01:01.160,0:01:03.250
The only connection they draw to Beethoven  is that

0:01:03.250,0:01:05.580
...he’s generally revered by
people in the classical world,

0:01:05.580,0:01:07.420
...and the classical world is full of snobs.

0:01:13.050,0:01:14.210
Later, they even say:

0:01:22.290,0:01:23.070
Er, okay.

0:01:23.070,0:01:25.170
Well, wouldn’t a better title be something like:

0:01:27.650,0:01:28.180
...then?

0:01:28.180,0:01:29.530
[chuckles] What's with this image?

0:01:29.530,0:01:30.320
“Ssshhhhhh!”

0:01:30.320,0:01:33.420
This article is a weird example
of how to promote a podcast.

0:01:33.420,0:01:35.900
Put forward an eye-catching claim to get attention

0:01:35.900,0:01:39.110
...by trolling gullible classical music
listeners and sparking outrage,

0:01:39.110,0:01:41.390
...but then furiously backpedal back on that claim later

0:01:41.390,0:01:42.958
...because you know it doesn’t make any sense.

0:01:42.960,0:01:44.560
And spark outrage they did,

0:01:44.560,0:01:46.340
...probably more than they bargained for, actually,

0:01:46.340,0:01:48.320
...leaving us with this wonderful, um…

0:01:48.320,0:01:49.070
'debate':

0:02:05.380,0:02:06.580
Oh, God!

0:02:06.590,0:02:07.820
So this is the kind of

0:02:07.820,0:02:09.000
...'discourse' you get

0:02:09.000,0:02:12.820
...when you create sensationalised,
incoherent and poorly researched nonsense.

0:02:12.820,0:02:15.040
Lots of angry shouting about basically nothing.

0:02:15.040,0:02:16.540
And there has been a lot of valuable stuff

0:02:16.540,0:02:19.198
...written about elitism in
classical music over the years,

0:02:19.200,0:02:20.910
...some of which we’re going to look at later.

0:02:20.910,0:02:22.810
'Switched on Pop' could have drawn from this well,

0:02:22.810,0:02:24.030
...but chose not to.

0:02:24.030,0:02:25.010
During this debate,

0:02:25.010,0:02:26.880
...I did not see the topic of elitism discussed

0:02:26.880,0:02:28.140
...in any meaningful way,

0:02:28.140,0:02:29.800
...and this just isn’t good enough.

0:02:29.800,0:02:32.090
If you are a journalist or
a figure with a following,

0:02:32.090,0:02:34.030
...trying to make a serious comment on music,

0:02:34.030,0:02:36.690
...I think you have a duty to properly
research what you're talking about

0:02:36.690,0:02:38.550
...to seek to be as informative as possible

0:02:38.550,0:02:40.920
...in a way that doesn’t
deliberately generate antagonism.

0:02:40.920,0:02:43.310
That way, you could actually
win some hearts and minds,

0:02:43.310,0:02:45.170
...producing a net positive effect.

0:02:45.170,0:02:48.180
Elitism and exclusion are real
problems that need to be addressed,

0:02:48.520,0:02:50.230
...but antagonism won't get us there.

0:02:50.230,0:02:52.570
All that does is force the
people on the receiving end

0:02:52.570,0:02:53.940
...into a defensive crouch.

0:02:53.940,0:02:54.730
It’s lazy,

0:02:54.730,0:02:55.550
...and worse,

0:02:55.550,0:02:56.490
...it’s easy.

0:02:56.490,0:02:57.160
And, I mean,

0:02:57.160,0:03:00.078
...even if you wanted to paint
Beethoven as an unreformed elitist,

0:03:00.080,0:03:01.700
...you could at least do it with style!

0:03:01.700,0:03:03.190
There’s loads of ammunition available.

0:03:03.190,0:03:05.180
The guy was a half-mad emotional wreck.

0:03:05.180,0:03:06.480
He said all kinds of stuff:

0:03:11.110,0:03:12.550
Beethoven, 1798.

0:03:12.550,0:03:14.560
Yeah, that looks like a smoking gun, doesn’t it?

0:03:14.560,0:03:16.250
But if you were going to do it justice,

0:03:16.250,0:03:19.060
...you’d need to discuss that quote
in the right historical context,

0:03:19.060,0:03:20.500
...including the French Revolution.

0:03:20.500,0:03:23.420
You would need to paint an accurate
picture of Beethoven’s character flaws

0:03:23.420,0:03:25.510
...and put it in that in historical context too.

0:03:25.510,0:03:26.740
You would need to do work.

0:03:26.740,0:03:27.940
People aren’t simple.

0:03:27.940,0:03:29.340
Culture isn’t a straight line.

0:03:29.340,0:03:32.020
This quote is pretty useless without context.

0:03:32.020,0:03:34.140
And that leads me to the topic of this video:

0:03:34.140,0:03:35.730
elitism, which is fascinating

0:03:35.730,0:03:37.820
...because it is so sprawling and complicated,

0:03:37.820,0:03:40.950
...and more fundamental to music 
than I think many people realise.

0:03:40.950,0:03:43.860
It’s, of course, a core component
of any discussion about wealth,

0:03:43.860,0:03:46.040
...which can directly affect our musical tastes.

0:03:46.040,0:03:48.820
It can refer to barriers that
prevent people studying music

0:03:48.820,0:03:50.840
...and also barriers that dissuade listeners.

0:03:50.840,0:03:52.120
Two very different cases.

0:03:52.120,0:03:54.900
It's also caught up with many forms of stereotyping,

0:03:54.900,0:03:57.760
...and above all, is utterly entangled with identity

0:03:57.760,0:03:59.880
...and woven into the fabric of class division.

0:03:59.880,0:04:03.150
But it’s also awkwardly entangled
with things that we admire:

0:04:03.150,0:04:04.150
perfection,

0:04:04.150,0:04:05.050
...sophistication,

0:04:05.590,0:04:06.260
...genius.

0:04:06.680,0:04:07.730
Even more awkwardly,

0:04:07.730,0:04:10.520
...the idea of becoming a member
of an elite is, for some,

0:04:10.520,0:04:11.780
...clearly aspirational.

0:04:11.780,0:04:13.110
And because of this contradiction,

0:04:13.110,0:04:15.980
...accusations of elitism in music occur constantly,

0:04:15.980,0:04:17.610
...and perhaps a bit too liberally.

0:04:17.610,0:04:20.010
Because if you throw the term ‘elitist’ at someone,

0:04:20.010,0:04:21.390
...it has a cluster-bomb effect

0:04:21.390,0:04:24.000
...that torches their legitimacy 
in the eyes of others.

0:04:24.000,0:04:26.820
A shortcut that removes the need
to be fair or empathetic.

0:04:26.820,0:04:28.238
Perfect for a hot take.

0:04:28.240,0:04:30.240
The purpose of this video is to not do that.

0:04:30.240,0:04:31.800
It’s to look at elitism in music

0:04:31.800,0:04:33.860
...from multiple different angles and perspectives.

0:04:33.860,0:04:37.560
And this problem of not being able to 
simply define elitism as one thing

0:04:37.560,0:04:39.678
...has very much affected the form of this video,

0:04:39.680,0:04:41.590
...which is going to be made up of chapters,

0:04:41.590,0:04:44.220
...each one looking at elitism
from a very different angle,

0:04:44.220,0:04:45.400
...to try and untangle it

0:04:45.400,0:04:47.518
...so that we can be more appreciative and fair,

0:04:47.520,0:04:48.620
...and also to have fun,

0:04:48.620,0:04:50.540
...because elitism is sometimes

0:04:50.540,0:04:51.780
...actually quite funny.

0:04:51.780,0:04:54.250
There are not many narrative
straight lines in this video.

0:04:54.250,0:04:55.380
No single answer.

0:04:55.380,0:04:57.040
It’s the opposite of a hot take.

0:04:57.040,0:04:58.120
It’s, uh... It’s a:

0:04:59.630,0:05:01.390
And in the end, what I hope to achieve is

0:05:01.390,0:05:03.040
...a better kind of understanding...

0:05:07.690,0:05:09.390
...for a better kind of person!

0:05:12.330,0:05:13.060
Cheers!

0:05:24.880,0:05:27.550
Now, if we're going to talk about elitism in music,

0:05:27.880,0:05:29.620
...there’s only one place you’d start.

0:05:30.720,0:05:31.500
That’s right.

0:05:32.020,0:05:33.920
Ancient China, 5,000 years ago.

0:05:36.000,0:05:38.610
China’s most celebrated philosopher, Confucius,

0:05:38.610,0:05:41.770
...had a lot to say about the role that
music should play in shaping society.

0:05:41.770,0:05:44.790
He was informed in large part by the ‘5 classic texts’

0:05:44.790,0:05:47.010
...which tell us stories from Chinese legend.

0:05:47.010,0:05:48.450
One tendency of these legends

0:05:48.450,0:05:51.430
...is to attribute great
musical discoveries to emperors.

0:05:51.430,0:05:52.290
For example,

0:05:52.290,0:05:56.000
...music was "invented" around 2,953 B.C.

0:05:56.000,0:05:57.630
...by the Emperor Fu Xi,

0:05:57.630,0:05:59.760
...beginning with his design of the guqin,

0:05:59.760,0:06:01.830
...a string instrument comparable to the lute.

0:06:01.830,0:06:04.800
Later, around 2697 B.C.,

0:06:04.800,0:06:06.380
...another emperor, Huangdi,

0:06:06.380,0:06:08.180
...created the first Chinese scale.

0:06:08.180,0:06:10.580
He did this by sending one of
his ministers on a mission

0:06:10.580,0:06:13.180
...to locate a perfectly proportioned piece of bamboo,

0:06:13.180,0:06:15.580
...which was eventually found in the Kunlun Mountains.

0:06:15.580,0:06:16.680
And this piece of bamboo

0:06:16.680,0:06:18.370
...was then fashioned into a pitch-pipe

0:06:18.370,0:06:19.820
...that produced a fundamental tone,

0:06:19.820,0:06:22.158
...from which the first Chinese scale was derived.

0:06:22.160,0:06:22.870
So right away,

0:06:22.870,0:06:25.820
...a link is established between
the fundamental nature of music

0:06:25.820,0:06:28.100
...and the wisdom of those
rulers who discovered it

0:06:28.100,0:06:29.710
...and then shared it with their subjects.

0:06:29.710,0:06:31.210
And there are loads of  stories like this.

0:06:31.210,0:06:33.020
Confucius relates another incident

0:06:33.020,0:06:34.810
...where the goddess Sunü

0:06:34.810,0:06:36.930
...was performing for the Emperor Huangdi

0:06:36.930,0:06:39.630
...on a 50-stringed instrument called the 'se'.

0:06:39.630,0:06:42.070
It seems that the resulting
music was so deeply sad

0:06:42.070,0:06:44.180
...and affected the emperor so profoundly,

0:06:44.180,0:06:46.840
...that he ordered the number
of strings reduced by half,

0:06:46.840,0:06:49.400
...because that would cut the sadness down by half.

0:06:49.400,0:06:50.220
Um…

0:06:50.220,0:06:52.070
That’s not really how music works, Huangdi.

0:06:52.070,0:06:53.070
It’s a bit like saying,

0:06:53.070,0:06:54.478
"Hey, that book’s too sad."

0:06:54.480,0:06:55.760
"Delete half the alphabet."

0:06:55.760,0:06:56.430
I mean…

0:06:56.430,0:06:57.910
Oh yes, I don’t mean to tell you your business.

0:06:57.910,0:06:59.650
I know you invented the scale and all.

0:06:59.650,0:07:01.630
Now, if we’re to believe the ancient texts,

0:07:01.630,0:07:03.518
(and given everything we’ve heard so far,)

0:07:03.520,0:07:05.020
(...why would we have reason to doubt?),

0:07:05.020,0:07:06.810
...this was not an isolated incident.

0:07:06.810,0:07:09.950
Emperors were forever taking a hand
in the music of their subjects.

0:07:10.190,0:07:11.278
But why?

0:07:11.280,0:07:13.530
Well, if we look at one of the 5 ancient texts,

0:07:13.530,0:07:14.920
...the 'Liji', we can see that

0:07:14.920,0:07:17.920
...there was an enormous spiritual
importance placed on music,

0:07:17.920,0:07:20.060
...and specifically on musical intervals.

0:07:20.060,0:07:22.140
If we take the perfect 5th for example:

0:07:24.610,0:07:26.950
...this was considered the
most special interval of all

0:07:26.950,0:07:29.970
...because its tones correspond
to the ratio of 3:2.

0:07:37.140,0:07:40.230
So music was not just a
source of aesthetic enjoyment,

0:07:40.230,0:07:42.060
...but a crucial tool that helped mankind

0:07:42.060,0:07:44.150
...appreciate and preserve cosmic balance.

0:07:44.400,0:07:45.560
Building on this idea,

0:07:45.560,0:07:46.550
...it came to be believed

0:07:46.550,0:07:49.290
...that the five notes of the scale
needed to be tuned perfectly

0:07:49.290,0:07:50.950
...in order to maintain social balance:

0:08:00.450,0:08:02.350
It actually goes much further than this.

0:08:02.350,0:08:05.380
Each individual tone was considered
to have a unique significance

0:08:05.380,0:08:07.358
...for a specific aspect of society.

0:08:07.360,0:08:09.760
I’ve put a link in the description
to a paper on this topic

0:08:09.760,0:08:11.438
...for anyone who wants to learn more.

0:08:11.440,0:08:14.180
Anyway, it was for this reason
that Confucius considered music

0:08:14.180,0:08:16.690
...to be a higher discipline than governance or law

0:08:16.690,0:08:18.730
...because he believed it had
a more fundamental impact

0:08:18.730,0:08:20.520
...on moral and social balance.

0:08:20.520,0:08:21.750
Moreover, he argued

0:08:21.750,0:08:24.110
...that anyone who aspired
to a high ranking position

0:08:24.110,0:08:26.220
...should have a sophisticated musical training,

0:08:26.220,0:08:28.500
...which would enable them to censor musical output

0:08:28.500,0:08:31.470
...and thereby safeguard the
moral character of the population.

0:08:31.470,0:08:32.900
And in making his case,

0:08:32.900,0:08:36.070
...Confucius references another
ancient text, called the 'Shu King',

0:08:36.070,0:08:38.590
...which tells a story about
another emperor called Shun.

0:08:38.590,0:08:41.360
The story goes that in order
to maintain social balance,

0:08:41.360,0:08:43.640
...Shun would tour the villages of China every year

0:08:43.640,0:08:46.060
...to test how they tuned their
instruments, which he believed

0:08:46.060,0:08:48.560
...would reveal to him the
precise nature of their problems.

0:08:48.560,0:08:49.520
And based on this,

0:08:49.520,0:08:52.718
...he’d prescribe remedies to balance
their social and economic health.

0:08:52.720,0:08:54.220
“This tuning is defective,"

0:08:54.220,0:08:56.398
"...which tells me your village is too big."

0:08:56.400,0:08:59.300
"Please dispose of all children
aged between 12 and 16."

0:08:59.300,0:08:59.840
"Thank you!”

0:09:06.650,0:09:07.450
[screams and hacking noises]

0:09:07.450,0:09:08.370
So, to summarise,

0:09:08.370,0:09:10.590
...a core component of the Confucian tradition

0:09:10.590,0:09:12.030
...is that the people of ancient China

0:09:12.030,0:09:14.330
...needed the musical oversight of their rulers

0:09:14.330,0:09:15.838
...because, according to Confucius,

0:09:15.840,0:09:18.400
...there was only one way music
should be written and performed.

0:09:19.340,0:09:20.250
The right way.

0:09:20.960,0:09:32.100
♪♪

0:09:36.400,0:09:38.460
In a uniquely awful book called

0:09:38.460,0:09:40.060
‘The Secret Power of Music’,

0:09:40.060,0:09:42.060
...the author David Tame makes the case

0:09:42.060,0:09:44.840
...that the music of today has led us to degeneracy,

0:09:44.840,0:09:46.950
...and that in order to regain spiritual balance,

0:09:46.950,0:09:49.570
...we must return to the musical ideas of Confucius.

0:09:49.570,0:09:51.220
It’s a real roller-coaster ride

0:09:51.220,0:09:54.990
...that takes you from one flabbergastingly
ignorant assertion to the next:

0:09:58.980,0:10:01.918
Yeah, everyone was just coasting
during that 20th century.

0:10:01.920,0:10:03.520
There’s another part in the book that I love

0:10:03.520,0:10:04.860
...where David suggests

0:10:04.860,0:10:06.840
...that if 7 horn players got together

0:10:06.840,0:10:08.140
...and played in unison,

0:10:08.140,0:10:10.740
...they would be capable of
producing a sound so powerful

0:10:10.740,0:10:13.570
...that it could reduce fortified
stone walls to rubble.

0:10:14.070,0:10:14.830
[chuckles]

0:10:14.830,0:10:16.050
Why does he think this?

0:10:16.050,0:10:16.638
Because

0:10:16.640,0:10:18.980
...that’s what the Bible
says happened at Jericho.

0:10:18.980,0:10:20.840
He goes on then to scold science

0:10:20.840,0:10:22.890
...for not being advanced
enough to prove him right.

0:10:22.890,0:10:23.920
It’s brilliant!

0:10:23.920,0:10:24.800
Book of the month!

0:10:25.040,0:10:26.450
Well, it would be book of the month

0:10:26.450,0:10:29.120
...if it weren’t for a number
of comments strewn throughout

0:10:29.120,0:10:31.560
...that are blatantly sexist,
homophobic or racist.

0:10:31.890,0:10:33.270
I’m not going to give examples here.

0:10:33.270,0:10:35.260
For the curious, I’ve put a link in the description.

0:10:35.590,0:10:36.638
(But, y'know, don’t bother)

0:10:36.640,0:10:39.670
Anyway, this whole package is a
strange appeal for spirituality

0:10:39.670,0:10:40.500
...and really puts the:

0:10:41.010,0:10:41.700
...in:

0:10:44.090,0:10:44.620
Sorry.

0:10:44.620,0:10:46.900
But there are three things in
particular about this book

0:10:46.900,0:10:48.190
...that I do find interesting.

0:10:48.190,0:10:50.330
The first is how strongly David believes

0:10:50.330,0:10:53.140
...in the rightness of Confucius’s
attitude towards music,

0:10:53.140,0:10:56.020
...that there is a spiritually
correct way to compose.

0:10:56.020,0:10:57.480
But we really don’t know

0:10:57.480,0:10:58.990
...what music from that era sounded like,

0:10:58.990,0:11:00.180
...since, for one thing,

0:11:00.180,0:11:02.420
...Confucius lived 500 years before Christ.

0:11:02.680,0:11:05.410
Not to mention, the occurrence in 212 BC

0:11:05.410,0:11:07.510
...of a catastrophe referred to as

0:11:07.510,0:11:09.040
...‘the burning of the books’,

0:11:09.040,0:11:11.790
...which was exactly as bad for
musical historians as it sounds.

0:11:12.040,0:11:13.610
The second thing I find interesting

0:11:13.610,0:11:16.130
...is how David conflates
this music he has never heard

0:11:16.130,0:11:18.320
...with the tradition of Western classical music,

0:11:18.320,0:11:20.430
...which he also thinks is spiritually correct.

0:11:20.430,0:11:23.190
Remember this point, because it's
gonna come up again in this video.

0:11:23.190,0:11:25.470
Third: in order to drive home his argument

0:11:25.470,0:11:28.140
...that the 20th century has utterly lost its way,

0:11:28.140,0:11:31.010
...David gives an example of a band that, for him,

0:11:31.010,0:11:33.690
...symbolises the total degeneracy of our age.

0:11:33.690,0:11:34.910
Can you guess who it is?

0:11:35.310,0:11:36.190
That’s right,

0:11:36.190,0:11:37.470
...it’s none other than

0:11:38.030,0:11:39.230
...the Sex Pistols?

0:11:39.230,0:11:39.850
Seriously?

0:11:39.850,0:11:42.120
The Sex Pistols? That’s the
worst thing you could think of?

0:11:42.120,0:11:42.740
Oh, no!

0:11:43.120,0:11:44.230
The working class!

0:11:44.750,0:11:46.610
Oooooooooooooh!

0:11:53.530,0:11:55.660
PRIEST:
"When punk rock groups like the Clash"

0:11:55.660,0:11:57.370
"...or the Sex Pistols perform,"

0:11:57.690,0:11:59.410
"...the hundreds of unemployed young people"

0:11:59.410,0:12:01.850
"...who go to their concerts
and listen to their songs"

0:12:02.340,0:12:03.500
"...know that those songs"

0:12:03.500,0:12:05.230
"...are the story of their lives."

0:12:05.580,0:12:07.690
MARTIN (narrating):
John Lydon, a.k.a. Jonny Rotten,

0:12:07.690,0:12:09.260
...lead singer of the Sex Pistols,

0:12:09.260,0:12:10.940
...once said in an interview that:

0:12:15.380,0:12:18.200
This sentiment has been repeated
by the band consistently,

0:12:18.200,0:12:20.850
...that their music was a means of
asserting their identities,

0:12:20.850,0:12:21.810
...unfiltered,

0:12:21.810,0:12:24.340
...in response to what they
considered to be a hostile culture

0:12:24.340,0:12:26.500
...that regularly made them feel worthless.

0:12:26.500,0:12:27.340
For example,

0:12:27.340,0:12:29.380
...in the documentary 'The Filth and the Fury',

0:12:29.380,0:12:32.078
...John describes his
experience of early education:

0:12:32.080,0:12:34.350
JOHN:
“I questioned everything.
I always have done."

0:12:34.670,0:12:36.460
"We were doing Shakespeare."

0:12:36.460,0:12:38.200
"A teacher would give me a hard time"

0:12:38.200,0:12:40.710
"...and he wouldn’t tell me
what I wanted to know."

0:12:40.710,0:12:42.820
"I’d ask outright questions,"

0:12:42.820,0:12:44.710
"...and you’re not supposed to do that."

0:12:44.710,0:12:46.210
"You’re just supposed to accept."

0:12:46.210,0:12:48.770
"It’s Shakespeare. It’s great. You’re not.”

0:12:49.120,0:12:50.160
And with this in mind,

0:12:50.160,0:12:53.038
...it’s fascinating to think
that only a few years later,

0:12:53.040,0:12:55.290
...just as the Sex Pistols were breaking through,

0:12:55.290,0:12:57.950
...a similarly unfavourable
comparison to ‘high culture’

0:12:57.950,0:13:01.300
...was thrown at him by the interviewer
Bill Grundy on live television.

0:13:01.450,0:13:02.720
BILL:
"Punk rockers."

0:13:03.340,0:13:04.958
"The new craze, they tell me."

0:13:04.960,0:13:06.930
MARTIN (narrating):
Now, for anyone who isn’t familiar with this

0:13:06.930,0:13:08.180
...train wreck of an interview,

0:13:08.180,0:13:09.470
...it’s well worth watching.

0:13:09.470,0:13:11.918
It’s also really hard to
make out what anyone is saying,

0:13:11.920,0:13:13.660
...but let me give it to you raw first:

0:13:14.310,0:13:14.850
GLEN: What?

0:13:14.850,0:13:16.280
BILL: Are you serious, or are you just making-

0:13:16.280,0:13:17.260
BILL: ...trying to make me laugh?
GLEN: Yeah.

0:13:17.630,0:13:18.680
GLEN: Yeah.
BILL: You are serious?

0:13:18.680,0:13:19.220
GLEN: Mmm.

0:13:19.580,0:13:20.340
Bill: Beethoven,

0:13:20.780,0:13:21.370
...Mozart,

0:13:21.560,0:13:23.200
BILL: ...Bach, Brahms…
JOHNNY: They’re all heroes of ours ain’t they?

0:13:23.200,0:13:23.990
[?]

0:13:23.990,0:13:26.230
BILL: Really? [?]
JOHNNY: They’re wonderful people!

0:13:26.530,0:13:27.060
BILL: Are they?

0:13:27.060,0:13:27.730
JOHNNY: Oh, yes.

0:13:27.730,0:13:29.000
They really turn us on.

0:13:29.000,0:13:30.450
BILL: Suppose they turn other people on?

0:13:31.440,0:13:33.050
JOHNNY: Well, that’s just their tough shit.

0:13:33.050,0:13:33.670
BILL: It’s what?

0:13:33.670,0:13:35.040
Now, if you want to catch that again,

0:13:35.040,0:13:37.170
...here’s a more coherent dramatisation:

0:13:37.170,0:13:38.680
BILL: I want to know one thing.

0:13:38.680,0:13:39.490
GLEN: What?

0:13:39.670,0:13:40.700
BILL: Are you serious,

0:13:40.700,0:13:41.630
...or are you just making me-

0:13:41.630,0:13:42.398
...trying to make me laugh?

0:13:43.850,0:13:45.400
BILL: Beethoven, Mozart,

0:13:45.400,0:13:47.330
...Bach, and Brahms have all died...

0:13:47.330,0:13:50.410
MARTIN (narrating):
So, this is Bill’s shorthand for sophistication:

0:13:50.410,0:13:53.080
Beethoven, Mozart, Bach, Brahms, et cetera.

0:13:53.080,0:13:54.050
And is there any wonder,

0:13:54.050,0:13:57.400
...given John’s previous experience
of exactly this kind of comparison,

0:13:57.400,0:13:59.038
...that he reacted the way he did?

0:13:59.800,0:14:01.580
BILL: [?]
JOHNNY: They’re wonderful people!

0:14:01.580,0:14:02.360
BILL: Are they?

0:14:02.360,0:14:04.238
JOHNNY: Yes, they really turn us on!

0:14:04.240,0:14:06.680
MARTIN (narrating):
Later, when asked why he
goaded the group in this way,

0:14:06.680,0:14:08.560
...Grundy explained that his actions were:

0:14:13.110,0:14:15.130
And no doubt, there was serious antagonism

0:14:15.130,0:14:17.030
...coming from the band’s side too.

0:14:17.030,0:14:18.760
I mean, did you spot the armband

0:14:18.760,0:14:20.430
...one of the entourage is wearing?

0:14:20.430,0:14:22.280
[sighs] There’s a whole story behind that too,

0:14:22.280,0:14:23.400
...but I won’t go into it now.

0:14:23.400,0:14:26.070
There’s also Steve Jones’s
famous cursing at the end.

0:14:26.070,0:14:27.790
BILL: Go on, you have another five seconds.

0:14:27.790,0:14:28.840
BILL: Say something outrageous.

0:14:28.840,0:14:29.990
STEVE: You dirty bastard.

0:14:29.990,0:14:31.060
MARTIN (narrating):
Oh, you’ve just gotta watch it!

0:14:31.060,0:14:32.290
BILL: I’ll be seeing you soon.

0:14:32.290,0:14:33.460
I hope I’m not seeing you again.

0:14:33.460,0:14:34.660
MARTIN (narrating):
Anyway, that aside,

0:14:34.660,0:14:35.960
...from a class point of view,

0:14:35.960,0:14:37.670
...this is such a divisive interview

0:14:37.670,0:14:40.000
...because there was a lot of
media attention paid to it

0:14:40.000,0:14:42.240
...and it clearly motivated people to take sides.

0:14:42.240,0:14:43.390
BRIAN: Punk rock has become

0:14:43.390,0:14:45.890
...almost a battle cry in British society.

0:14:45.890,0:14:46.820
For many people,

0:14:46.820,0:14:48.940
...it’s a greater threat to our way of life than

0:14:48.940,0:14:51.070
...Russian communism or hyperinflation,

0:14:51.070,0:14:53.870
...and it certainly generates
more popular excitement

0:14:53.870,0:14:54.890
...than either of those.

0:14:54.890,0:14:56.030
Can I now turn to

0:14:56.030,0:14:57.730
...Bernard Brooke-Partridge in London?

0:14:57.980,0:14:59.380
BROOKE-PARTRIDGE: I think most of these groups

0:14:59.380,0:15:01.678
...would be vastly improved by sudden death.

0:15:01.680,0:15:04.190
The worst currently are the Sex Pistols

0:15:04.190,0:15:07.358
...and they are the antithesis of human kind.

0:15:07.360,0:15:09.690
MARTIN (narrating):
And what I find sad about all of this antagonism

0:15:09.690,0:15:11.990
...is how Bill is using historical figures in music

0:15:11.990,0:15:14.270
...to try and put a working class kid in his place.

0:15:14.270,0:15:16.158
It’s such a misuse of Mozart’s name.

0:15:16.160,0:15:17.540
And John’s dismissal of Mozart,

0:15:17.540,0:15:19.830
...although absolutely appropriate for the moment,

0:15:19.830,0:15:21.900
...also strikes me as kind of sad too.

0:15:21.900,0:15:24.910
It just feels like resentment
trumped empathy on both sides here,

0:15:24.910,0:15:27.280
...and the nuances of history
were discarded in favour of

0:15:27.280,0:15:29.220
...unquestioned adoration on the one side

0:15:29.220,0:15:30.950
...or total dismissal on the other.

0:15:30.950,0:15:33.150
And I can’t help but wonder
if, in a different world,

0:15:33.150,0:15:35.920
...where people didn’t invoke
Mozart’s name as if it was

0:15:35.920,0:15:38.230
...the musical equivalent of a Rolex watch,

0:15:38.230,0:15:40.910
...John could possibly find
something admirable about him.

0:15:54.160,0:15:55.990
Towards the end of 1790,

0:15:55.990,0:15:58.318
...a year before his death at the age of 35,

0:15:58.320,0:16:00.220
...Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart had reached

0:16:00.220,0:16:01.970
...a point of complete despair.

0:16:01.970,0:16:03.180
He had spent the last four years

0:16:03.180,0:16:05.820
...doing everything in his power
to attain a steady income.

0:16:05.820,0:16:07.690
His family were living well beyond their means,

0:16:07.690,0:16:10.610
...and his financial situation
was becoming increasingly worse

0:16:10.610,0:16:11.840
...due to a lack of commissions

0:16:11.840,0:16:13.740
...and a falling out of favour in Vienna.

0:16:13.740,0:16:14.930
To make matters worse,

0:16:14.930,0:16:16.350
...his wife was extremely ill,

0:16:16.350,0:16:18.450
...and after being disinherited by his father

0:16:18.450,0:16:20.060
...and estranged from his sister,

0:16:20.060,0:16:21.640
...he had no family to turn to.

0:16:21.640,0:16:23.650
His letters during this period are filled with

0:16:23.650,0:16:25.940
...anguish and terror at
what the future might hold,

0:16:25.940,0:16:28.740
...and as a last resort, he
began begging from his friends:

0:16:40.400,0:16:42.880
For a man with the stature that Mozart has today,

0:16:42.880,0:16:44.830
...it can come as a shock when you first learn about

0:16:44.830,0:16:47.150
...the incredibly unstable financial situation

0:16:47.150,0:16:49.000
...that marred the final years of his life,

0:16:49.000,0:16:51.570
...and most likely contributed to his early death.

0:16:51.570,0:16:54.230
But what is particularly
telling about his misfortune

0:16:54.230,0:16:56.440
...is that it came about directly as a result of

0:16:56.440,0:16:59.450
...his rejection of the systems
controlled by the ruling classes

0:16:59.450,0:17:01.520
...and his insistence on artistic freedom.

0:17:01.520,0:17:04.390
Freedom that may have immortalised
him as a composer today,

0:17:04.390,0:17:05.700
...but in his own lifetime,

0:17:05.700,0:17:07.210
...led to his financial ruin.

0:17:07.210,0:17:08.840
A life that ended in misery.

0:17:08.840,0:17:10.680
To understand why, we need to consider

0:17:10.680,0:17:13.830
...what the social standing of a
composer was during this period.

0:17:13.830,0:17:15.890
Mozart may have been a famous child prodigy

0:17:15.890,0:17:17.700
...whose family toured the courts of Europe,

0:17:17.700,0:17:20.330
...but they were received as
merely travelling performers,

0:17:20.330,0:17:21.860
...albeit very talented ones,

0:17:21.860,0:17:24.570
...who lived off the invitations
and gifts of the nobility.

0:17:24.570,0:17:26.270
The Empress Maria Theresa

0:17:26.270,0:17:27.740
...referred to the Mozarts as:

0:17:28.750,0:17:30.930
...and advised her son Archduke Ferdinand

0:17:30.930,0:17:33.260
...not to employ the then-teenage Mozart because:

0:17:38.720,0:17:40.800
However, despite these kinds of attitudes,

0:17:40.800,0:17:43.160
...gaining a position at court
was crucial for Mozart

0:17:43.160,0:17:45.430
...if he wished to be a professional composer.

0:17:45.430,0:17:47.990
The influential sociologist Norbert Elias

0:17:47.990,0:17:51.130
...has a great book about Mozart
that specifically covers this topic:

0:18:12.570,0:18:14.850
Composers had a middle-ranking status at court

0:18:14.850,0:18:18.260
...that was comparable to
pastry chefs, cooks and valets.

0:18:18.260,0:18:20.570
It would be better to consider
a composer from these times

0:18:20.570,0:18:22.480
...as being closer to a craftsperson

0:18:22.480,0:18:25.820
...who created works that fitted the
aesthetic requirements of those in power.

0:18:25.820,0:18:27.350
And just like a craftsperson,

0:18:27.350,0:18:30.420
...if a composer travelled too
far beyond current fashions,

0:18:30.420,0:18:33.140
...they risked losing the favour
of court, and consequently,

0:18:33.140,0:18:34.940
...any chance of a career as a composer.

0:18:34.940,0:18:37.100
And what is incredibly important to understand here

0:18:37.100,0:18:39.470
...is that the options available to composers today

0:18:39.470,0:18:41.050
...largely did not exist then.

0:18:41.050,0:18:42.860
The ruling class were the government,

0:18:42.860,0:18:44.650
...although thankfully not for very much longer.

0:18:45.040,0:18:46.430
In 1777,

0:18:46.430,0:18:49.918
...Mozart resigned his position at the
court of the Archbishop of Salzburg

0:18:49.920,0:18:51.610
...due to multiple frustrations.

0:18:51.610,0:18:53.230
Apart from having to limit his output

0:18:53.230,0:18:55.080
...to suit the tastes and conventions of court,

0:18:55.080,0:18:57.860
...he was underpaid and generally
dragged around the country

0:18:57.860,0:19:00.480
...to perform at the Archbishop’s
whim, like a servant.

0:19:00.480,0:19:02.970
In a letter to his father, Mozart recounts how,

0:19:02.970,0:19:05.410
...when he insisted on being
released from his position,

0:19:05.410,0:19:07.670
...the Archbishop’s steward
dragged him out of the building

0:19:07.670,0:19:09.730
...and literally kicked him
on his way out the door.

0:19:09.730,0:19:11.300
It didn’t matter that Mozart had performed

0:19:11.300,0:19:13.360
...at the most prestigious
courts all over the world.

0:19:13.360,0:19:14.940
It didn’t matter that Marie Antoinette

0:19:14.940,0:19:16.920
...had once doted on him when he was a child.

0:19:16.920,0:19:19.390
His standing as one of the most
revered musicians in the world

0:19:19.390,0:19:21.070
...couldn’t change the social fact

0:19:21.070,0:19:22.450
...that in the court hierarchy,

0:19:22.450,0:19:24.340
...he was still simply a musician.

0:19:24.730,0:19:26.530
Mozart’s experience as a young man

0:19:26.530,0:19:29.640
...of travelling all over Europe in
search of a position at another court

0:19:29.640,0:19:31.490
...was almost uniformly negative.

0:19:31.490,0:19:33.690
After one unsuccessful encounter in Paris,

0:19:33.690,0:19:34.670
...he wrote to his father:

0:19:39.840,0:19:42.720
And so after years of being treated in this way,

0:19:42.720,0:19:45.380
...Mozart, who was both highly
confident of his skills

0:19:45.380,0:19:48.190
...and aware that his musical
reputation was second to none,

0:19:48.190,0:19:51.280
...took the incredibly brave, and
at that time unheard of, decision

0:19:51.280,0:19:53.550
...to go out on his own and
become a freelance artist,

0:19:53.550,0:19:56.940
...relying on his own connections, 
reputation and organisational ability

0:19:56.940,0:19:58.640
...to provide an income for his family

0:19:58.640,0:20:01.780
...while finally being able to
follow his own muse as a composer.

0:20:01.780,0:20:03.970
Rather than being a musical byproduct of a system

0:20:03.970,0:20:06.030
...dominated by a decaying ruling class,

0:20:06.030,0:20:08.190
...Mozart broke away in an attempt to be

0:20:08.190,0:20:10.690
...exactly the kind of composer that we revere today:

0:20:10.690,0:20:13.590
individual, visionary, and non-conforming.

0:20:13.590,0:20:16.840
However, it wasn’t quite so easy
to simply ‘break away’ completely.

0:20:16.840,0:20:19.280
Concerts were still largely an aristocratic affair

0:20:19.280,0:20:20.730
...and were invitation-only.

0:20:20.730,0:20:22.220
Yet, despite these difficulties,

0:20:22.220,0:20:23.110
...for a time,

0:20:23.110,0:20:26.260
...Mozart was very successful at
securing commissions and patronage.

0:20:26.260,0:20:27.490
But as fashions changed

0:20:27.490,0:20:29.850
...and foreign wars drained the Austrian coffers,

0:20:29.850,0:20:31.060
...he fell out of favour,

0:20:31.060,0:20:34.158
...and commissions began to go
instead to more compliant composers.

0:20:34.160,0:20:36.600
It is possible that had Mozart not died at 35,

0:20:36.600,0:20:39.040
...he may have dug himself out
of this financial predicament.

0:20:39.040,0:20:40.650
He made this leap into the unknown

0:20:40.650,0:20:43.580
...in direct opposition to the
kinds of domination and control

0:20:43.580,0:20:46.280
...that the aristocracy assumed was theirs by right.

0:20:46.280,0:20:49.780
It is quite different to the rebelliousness
demonstrated by the Sex Pistols,

0:20:49.780,0:20:51.150
...but it is similar in some way,

0:20:51.150,0:20:53.580
...in that Mozart wanted to break free of social bonds

0:20:53.580,0:20:55.220
...that both limited his art form

0:20:55.220,0:20:57.130
...and disrespected him as a composer,

0:20:57.130,0:20:59.190
...and he took on enormous risk by doing so.

0:20:59.190,0:21:00.680
A risk that has benefitted us

0:21:00.680,0:21:04.190
...a lot more than it materially
benefited him in his own lifetime.

0:21:22.320,0:21:23.760
On the topic of elitism,

0:21:23.760,0:21:25.440
...I often think that we in the West

0:21:25.440,0:21:27.118
...are caught in a bit of a daydream.

0:21:27.120,0:21:28.500
And it often seems that we think

0:21:28.500,0:21:30.878
...that the problem of elitism happens on the fringes,

0:21:30.880,0:21:32.740
...and all that we need to do is call it out

0:21:32.740,0:21:33.970
...for it to be eliminated.

0:21:33.970,0:21:35.350
The favourite whipping boy is

0:21:35.350,0:21:37.870
...obviously classical music and its link to privilege,

0:21:37.870,0:21:40.650
(which is undoubtedly a real
problem and we’ll get to that)

0:21:40.650,0:21:42.010
...but musical elitism,

0:21:42.010,0:21:43.850
...the belief that there are superior people

0:21:43.850,0:21:46.860
...who naturally occupy a premier
status above everyone else,

0:21:46.860,0:21:50.350
...is the dominant social reality
of nearly every musical genre.

0:21:50.350,0:21:51.500
We just don’t notice it,

0:21:51.500,0:21:53.550
...because it’s been like this our entire lives.

0:21:53.550,0:21:55.900
Let’s start by looking at the incredibly high status

0:21:55.900,0:21:58.750
...that we in the West confer
upon the role of the artist,

0:21:58.750,0:22:02.060
...whose fierce independence and refusal
to cater to the tastes of the public

0:22:02.060,0:22:02.930
...is celebrated.

0:22:02.930,0:22:05.570
Historically, this is a relatively recent phenomenon.

0:22:05.570,0:22:06.650
In older cultures,

0:22:06.650,0:22:08.540
...music was often seen as something that served

0:22:08.540,0:22:10.240
...a specific practical function.

0:22:10.240,0:22:13.210
We saw this a moment ago when
looking at Mozart’s period in Vienna,

0:22:13.210,0:22:16.500
...where music was most commonly
written for banquets and dancing halls.

0:22:16.500,0:22:18.810
Even the most skilled and revered composers,

0:22:18.810,0:22:20.230
...who were allowed the most freedom,

0:22:20.230,0:22:23.110
...had to operate within the tastes
of the court that they served in,

0:22:23.110,0:22:25.840
...to project the magnificence
and fashionability of that court.

0:22:25.840,0:22:27.850
As Norbert Elias writes of this period:

0:22:39.060,0:22:39.800
Today,

0:22:39.800,0:22:41.850
...we celebrate the inversion of this relationship.

0:22:42.120,0:22:44.010
The artist’s independence is revered

0:22:44.010,0:22:45.880
...and their boundary-breaking is seen as

0:22:45.880,0:22:47.678
...forward-looking and evolutionary,

0:22:47.680,0:22:50.700
...something that leads the way for
regular listeners to catch up to.

0:22:50.700,0:22:54.190
The idea of artists who write music to
cater to the wants of their audience

0:22:54.190,0:22:56.290
...is routinely looked down upon as

0:22:56.290,0:22:57.620
...‘safe’ or ‘commercial’.

0:22:57.620,0:22:58.590
And because of this,

0:22:58.590,0:23:00.780
...the more successful the songwriter or composer,

0:23:00.780,0:23:02.430
...the more they’re treated like gods

0:23:02.430,0:23:04.250
...and the more their stories are mythologised.

0:23:04.250,0:23:05.780
And this isn’t hard to spot.

0:23:05.780,0:23:08.270
It’s a fundamental component of most music marketing

0:23:08.270,0:23:10.180
...and a mainstay of music journalism.

0:23:10.180,0:23:13.010
Note the ludicrous mythology
built up around Bob Dylan

0:23:13.010,0:23:14.900
...by the likes of Rolling Stone magazine.

0:23:14.900,0:23:15.950
I like Bob Dylan.

0:23:15.950,0:23:17.170
He’s got some really nice music,

0:23:17.170,0:23:19.610
...but like all musicians, he has many flaws.

0:23:19.610,0:23:21.800
But in the 90’s, the early 2000’s,

0:23:21.800,0:23:22.930
...and even still today,

0:23:22.930,0:23:24.060
...you wouldn’t know it.

0:23:34.120,0:23:35.360
[sighs] Give me a break!

0:23:35.360,0:23:37.310
There’s a movie about him called

0:23:37.310,0:23:38.540
‘Masked and Anonymous’,

0:23:38.540,0:23:42.130
...which is one of the most insufferably
obsequious odes you’ll ever see.

0:23:42.130,0:23:45.500
It's meant to be about a fictional
character who's based on Bob Dylan

0:23:45.500,0:23:48.790
...but it's set to the actual
music of Bob Dylan and, even worse,

0:23:48.790,0:23:50.070
...stars Bob Dylan.

0:23:50.070,0:23:50.940
Yeah, that's right.

0:23:50.940,0:23:54.120
He’s playing a fictional character
that is celebrating himself.

0:23:54.120,0:23:57.460
And celebrities seem to be tripping
over themselves to be in this movie.

0:23:57.460,0:23:59.910
He must be so confused by the never-ending adoration

0:23:59.910,0:24:03.100
...that I can’t imagine he’s able to
distinguish dream from reality anymore.

0:24:03.100,0:24:04.000
Apart from that,

0:24:04.000,0:24:06.770
...it’s hard to watch the super
famous musicians of this era

0:24:06.770,0:24:08.990
...take to the stage in front of rapturous crowds

0:24:08.990,0:24:11.380
...and think ‘yes, this is a flat hierarchy’.

0:24:11.380,0:24:12.630
We’re forever informed about

0:24:12.630,0:24:15.830
...the awards ceremonies and soirees
that the musical stars attend

0:24:15.830,0:24:17.370
...with the rest of the rich and famous.

0:24:17.370,0:24:20.130
And the entire industry is
obsessed with literal rankings

0:24:20.130,0:24:21.700
...to see who is the most elite.

0:24:21.700,0:24:22.840
The Billboard 100.

0:24:22.840,0:24:23.750

Do you have what it takes to
be America’s next pop idol?

0:24:35.800,0:24:37.198
Only one may win.

...but Beyonce had one of
the best videos of all time.

0:24:47.000,0:24:48.238
Of all time!

0:24:48.240,0:24:50.180
Do I need to mention the throwing-money thing?

0:24:50.180,0:24:52.070
Or the conspicuous-consumption thing?

0:24:52.070,0:24:54.290
Or the giant-corporation-that-directs-our-kids-

0:24:54.290,0:24:56.570
...to-form-an-obsession-with-princesses thing?

0:24:56.570,0:24:58.870
Now, I’m by no means describing all music,

0:24:58.870,0:25:00.920
...but I’m certainly describing a very noticeable,

0:25:00.920,0:25:02.810
...widespread and mainstream part of it.

0:25:02.810,0:25:04.710
The presentation of musical artists

0:25:04.710,0:25:06.950
...as perfect, ethereal beings

0:25:06.950,0:25:07.760
...never ceases.

0:25:07.760,0:25:09.390
Their success and material wealth

0:25:09.390,0:25:11.800
...is often directly associated with their music.

0:25:11.800,0:25:13.630
Taylor, I'mma let you finish, but…

0:25:13.630,0:25:14.600
...what’s with you?

0:25:14.600,0:25:16.158
Forever swimming in diamonds.

0:25:16.160,0:25:19.19
Projecting images of yourself
living in luxury with your ideal...

0:25:19.190,0:25:21.540
...men's-fashion-department-store-wallpaper husband

0:25:21.540,0:25:22.980
...and your… car.

0:25:22.980,0:25:24.770
Look at that rich, rich car.

0:25:24.770,0:25:26.570
I don’t know much about cars, but man…

0:25:27.050,0:25:28.110
...THAT’s a car.

0:25:28.110,0:25:30.150
And it didn’t get here by accident, by the way.

0:25:30.150,0:25:32.820
There’s a public relations
firm who saw an opportunity

0:25:32.820,0:25:35.118
...to have this car placed in this video.

0:25:35.120,0:25:35.920
But why?

0:25:35.920,0:25:37.080
Why would they do this?

0:25:37.080,0:25:38.530
Why are cars and mansions

0:25:38.530,0:25:39.860
...and beauty and perfection

0:25:39.860,0:25:42.720
...so prominently associated with musical talent?

0:25:42.720,0:25:43.250
Well,

0:25:43.250,0:25:45.420
...there’s only one answer I
can think of that makes sense,

0:25:45.420,0:25:46.910
...and it’s not nice to face.

0:25:47.250,0:25:49.700
Because success and status are marketable.

0:25:49.700,0:25:51.890
It taps into something powerful within us.

0:25:51.890,0:25:53.580
Something that we dare not admit

0:25:53.580,0:25:56.390
...but are clearly drawn to in
some horrible, horrible way.

0:25:56.390,0:25:59.200
Because it represents our own aspirations

0:25:59.200,0:26:00.520
...to make it to the top.

0:26:00.520,0:26:01.598
To be the most beautiful.

0:26:01.600,0:26:02.580
To win the awards.

0:26:02.580,0:26:03.600
To own the car.

0:26:03.600,0:26:05.390
To be the person on the altar.

0:26:05.390,0:26:07.220
We can’t keep away from this aspiration,

0:26:07.220,0:26:08.220
...and to some extent,

0:26:08.220,0:26:09.680
(especially when we’re younger)

0:26:09.680,0:26:11.518
...these people represent our dreams.

0:26:11.520,0:26:14.250
We read the 'Top 100 Guitarists
of All Time' article and-

0:26:14.610,0:26:15.630
Oh, for Christ’s sake!

0:26:15.790,0:26:17.150
We all want to be successful

0:26:17.150,0:26:18.860
...and we all want to be the best,

0:26:18.860,0:26:20.930
...but we know that these wants are destructive

0:26:20.930,0:26:22.860
...and lead to unfairness and resentment.

0:26:22.860,0:26:24.500
So, we hate elitism,

0:26:24.500,0:26:26.680
...because it naturally forces social divisions.

0:26:26.680,0:26:28.730
We don’t want there to be a privileged hierarchy,

0:26:28.730,0:26:31.380
...we recognise that the idea is grossly unfair.

0:26:31.380,0:26:32.558
But despite that,

0:26:32.560,0:26:34.530
...if we’re to judge ourselves on a macro scale,

0:26:34.530,0:26:36.050
...as the English-speaking West,

0:26:36.050,0:26:37.680
...we permit musical elitism

0:26:37.680,0:26:39.350
...not just to exist on the fringes,

0:26:39.720,0:26:41.770
...but to thrive in the mainstream.

0:26:56.450,0:26:57.890
I think it’s safe to say that

0:26:57.890,0:26:59.750
...classical music has an image problem,

0:26:59.750,0:27:03.160
...one that greatly hampers its
ability to attract new audiences.

0:27:03.160,0:27:05.150
There are many contributing factors to this:

0:27:05.150,0:27:05.920
privilege,

0:27:05.920,0:27:07.050
...social identity,

0:27:07.050,0:27:08.250
...historical legacy,

0:27:08.250,0:27:11.630
...and also a broadly negative
perception in wider popular culture.

0:27:11.630,0:27:12.800
Let’s start with privilege,

0:27:12.800,0:27:14.260
...focusing on the U.K.

0:27:14.260,0:27:15.358
In 2012,

0:27:15.360,0:27:17.140
...the columnist Andrew Mellor wrote that

0:27:17.140,0:27:19.460
...although there has been an
effort among U.K. concert halls

0:27:19.460,0:27:21.280
...to be more welcoming and inclusive,

0:27:21.280,0:27:22.700
(for example, at the Proms)

0:27:22.700,0:27:25.510
...that it doesn’t take long for
some aspect of the classical world

0:27:25.510,0:27:26.760
...to undermine that effort:

0:27:38.070,0:27:39.490
Now, in order to address this,

0:27:39.490,0:27:42.158
...let's look at a few statistics
on education provision.

0:27:42.160,0:27:44.510
Around 92% of children in the U.K.

0:27:44.510,0:27:47.050
...study in state schools,
which don't charge fees,

0:27:47.050,0:27:48.590
...and around 7% of children

0:27:48.590,0:27:50.718
...study in fee-paying private schools.

0:27:50.720,0:27:52.670
The average university enrolment in England

0:27:52.670,0:27:53.490
...looks like this:

0:27:53.780,0:27:55.260
90% are from state schools,

0:27:55.590,0:27:57.150
...10% are privately educated.

0:27:57.470,0:27:59.740
However, if you narrow in on classical music,

0:27:59.740,0:28:01.518
...the picture is wildly different.

0:28:01.520,0:28:03.270
For example, in 2017,

0:28:03.270,0:28:05.380
...at the Royal Academy of Music in London,

0:28:05.380,0:28:06.860
...state-school-educated students

0:28:06.860,0:28:09.160
...made up only 48% of the total.

0:28:09.160,0:28:11.110
That’s the worst disparity in the country,

0:28:11.110,0:28:13.330
...far worse than both Cambridge and Oxford.

0:28:13.330,0:28:15.410
The Royal College of Music, another conservatoire,

0:28:15.410,0:28:18.110
...only did a little better at 56%.

0:28:18.110,0:28:19.680
Now, for both those conservatoires,

0:28:19.680,0:28:22.890
...those statistics are actually
quite an improvement on previous years,

0:28:22.890,0:28:25.480
...and a good sign that they are
attempting to address this imbalance.

0:28:25.740,0:28:27.680
However, their efforts are being undermined

0:28:27.680,0:28:29.280
...at the primary education level.

0:28:29.280,0:28:33.120
A report by the British Phonographic
Industry in 2019 found that:

0:28:48.080,0:28:50.410
So, right away, we can see how in the U.K.,

0:28:50.410,0:28:52.010
...the more affluent your parents are,

0:28:52.010,0:28:54.370
...the more opportunities you’ll have to study music.

0:28:54.370,0:28:57.038
This produces a pretty fundamental problem:

0:28:57.040,0:28:59.950
many instruments are often just too costly and expensive.

0:28:59.950,0:29:01.850
So if a school has no free provision,

0:29:01.850,0:29:03.750
...children of low-income families who study there

0:29:03.750,0:29:05.510
...will have no opportunities at all,

0:29:05.510,0:29:07.000
...whereas those from wealthier backgrounds

0:29:07.000,0:29:09.350
...will at least have the option
of hiring a private tutor.

0:29:09.350,0:29:10.060
In addition,

0:29:10.060,0:29:13.370
...since classical music is a very
financially precarious profession,

0:29:13.370,0:29:15.820
...parents earning low incomes are far less likely

0:29:15.820,0:29:17.700
...to encourage their children to pursue it

0:29:17.700,0:29:19.610
...in favour of more stable professions.

0:29:19.610,0:29:22.330
Apart from the lack of opportunities
for low-income families,

0:29:22.330,0:29:25.620
...there’s also the issue of
under-representation of ethnic minorities

0:29:25.620,0:29:28.870
...and massive under-representation
of those with long-term disabilities.

0:29:28.870,0:29:30.860
Income can play a part here too,

0:29:30.860,0:29:33.190
...but there are many more
factors to take into account.

0:29:33.190,0:29:36.210
And I could only do them justice by
discussing them in separate videos.

0:29:36.210,0:29:38.440
For now, I’ve put a few links in the description

0:29:38.440,0:29:40.290
...to reports that go into much more detail.

0:29:40.290,0:29:43.070
It is worth mentioning that there
are those fighting back in the U.K.

0:29:43.070,0:29:45.210
...to help children from disadvantaged communities

0:29:45.210,0:29:47.370
...gain access to instruments and music lessons,

0:29:47.370,0:29:48.980
...such as the 'In Harmony' programme,

0:29:48.980,0:29:51.850
...which is supported by the Arts Council
and Department of Education.

0:29:51.850,0:29:54.638
I’ve provided a link to a
report about that programme too.

0:29:54.640,0:29:57.060
But despite bright spots
like the ‘In Harmony’ programme,

0:29:57.060,0:29:59.560
...the general decrease of
provision in state education

0:29:59.560,0:30:02.210
...is gradually pricing out poorer communities.

0:30:02.210,0:30:04.450
This perversely forces classical music to be

0:30:04.450,0:30:06.558
...something that only the more privileged can study,

0:30:06.560,0:30:09.050
...perpetuating and even hardening the class divide.

0:30:09.050,0:30:11.420
In the book 'Class, Control, and Classical Music',

0:30:11.420,0:30:13.230
...the author Anna Bull notes that:

0:30:28.290,0:30:30.100
But this is only one side of the coin.

0:30:30.100,0:30:31.290
On the other side is the

0:30:31.290,0:30:33.540
...cancerous image problem that classical music has,

0:30:33.540,0:30:36.640
...which can be clearly seen by looking
at its place in popular culture:

0:30:36.640,0:30:37.550
in advertising,

0:30:37.550,0:30:38.160
...branding,

0:30:38.160,0:30:38.830
...television,

0:30:38.830,0:30:39.350
...movies,

0:30:39.350,0:30:40.070
...broadcasting,

0:30:40.070,0:30:40.878
...everywhere.

0:30:40.880,0:30:42.070
Where do I even begin?

0:30:42.070,0:30:44.590
Let’s look at the popular HBO show 'Succession',

0:30:44.590,0:30:46.580
...which is about an extraordinarily wealthy

0:30:46.580,0:30:48.350
...but also highly dysfunctional family

0:30:48.350,0:30:50.250
...who sit at the head of a global news empire.

0:30:50.450,0:30:51.620
Think the Murdochs.

0:30:51.890,0:30:53.980
The show features a small cast of characters,

0:30:53.980,0:30:56.760
...who spend their time cynically
manoeuvring and backstabbing

0:30:56.760,0:30:58.820
...in an attempt to succeed their aging father,

0:30:58.820,0:30:59.890
...who is himself

0:30:59.890,0:31:02.200
...one of the most unlikable characters in TV history.

0:31:02.200,0:31:03.230
And throughout the show,

0:31:03.230,0:31:04.830
...as these characters travel around

0:31:04.830,0:31:07.580
...from one ridiculously opulent setting to the next,

0:31:07.580,0:31:08.720
...this is their soundtrack:

0:31:15.360,0:31:16.690
It’s the same story with the movie

0:31:16.690,0:31:17.650
'House of Gucci',

0:31:17.650,0:31:19.490
...also about a fabulously wealthy

0:31:19.490,0:31:21.140
...but highly dysfunctional family.

0:31:27.360,0:31:28.950
The reason this music is effective

0:31:28.950,0:31:30.950
...is because in both TV and cinema,

0:31:30.950,0:31:32.820
...music in the Classical or late-Baroque style

0:31:32.820,0:31:34.710
...has become a globally understood shorthand

0:31:34.710,0:31:36.390
...for wealth, opulence and privilege.

0:31:36.390,0:31:37.400
On the screen in general,

0:31:37.400,0:31:39.360
...classical music has become reified to the point

0:31:39.360,0:31:41.120
...where it just means ‘elitism’.

0:31:41.120,0:31:43.390
So even if we solved the first half of the problem,

0:31:43.390,0:31:45.950
(providing equal opportunities to study the art form)

0:31:45.950,0:31:49.140
...its image problem is unlikely
to go away anytime soon.

0:31:49.140,0:31:51.210
Advertisers often use classical music

0:31:51.210,0:31:53.480
...to help position their products in the premium space:

0:31:59.440,0:32:01.838
And then there’s this entire genre of car commercials,

0:32:01.840,0:32:04.370
...that fetishise the concept
of ‘engineering precision’

0:32:04.370,0:32:06.000
...by linking it to classical music.

0:32:06.000,0:32:08.140
One of the worst offenders here is Alfa Romeo:

0:32:17.240,0:32:19.240
...but the kings of this genre are Hyundai:

0:32:45.360,0:32:47.560
To dwell in the world of advertising for a moment,

0:32:47.560,0:32:49.160
...let's look at this ad for cognac

0:32:49.160,0:32:51.540
...and its use of the classical composer cliché:

0:32:52.300,0:32:53.690
YARON: This project

0:32:53.690,0:32:55.290
...was born around a challenge.

0:32:55.290,0:32:57.120
To try to translate into sound

0:32:57.120,0:32:58.180
...the magic

0:32:58.670,0:32:59.710
...of one note.

0:33:00.210,0:33:01.400
[glasses clinking]

0:33:01.690,0:33:03.420
MARTIN (narrating):
Ah, it’s just so sophisticated.

0:33:03.660,0:33:04.600
And then we watch

0:33:04.600,0:33:07.680
...as this composer applies his
genius to this musical challenge,

0:33:08.080,0:33:09.480
...following his impulses,

0:33:09.480,0:33:11.040
...pursuing his muse,

0:33:11.040,0:33:13.290
...free (I’m sure) from any external influence.

0:33:13.600,0:33:15.400
YARON: How can a little drop

0:33:15.400,0:33:16.660
...of Louis XIII

0:33:16.660,0:33:17.470
...resonate?

0:33:17.470,0:33:19.380
MARTIN (narrating):
Ah, Louis treize!

0:33:19.380,0:33:21.130
L’enfer, c’est les autres.

0:33:21.380,0:33:21.990
B- B- By-

0:33:21.990,0:33:24.140
By the way, you know a regular bottle of this stuff

0:33:24.140,0:33:25.580
...costs around £3000?

0:33:25.580,0:33:26.420
"The brandy,"

0:33:26.420,0:33:27.710
"...beloved by everyone"

0:33:28.040,0:33:29.160
"...from Napoleon"

0:33:29.160,0:33:30.158
"...to Jay-Z."

0:33:30.160,0:33:32.260
Hold on. How do we know Jay-Z drinks this stuff?

0:33:38.100,0:33:38.830
[laughs]

0:33:38.830,0:33:40.140
It's- It’s Louis TREIZE,

0:33:40.140,0:33:40.970
...uh, Jay-Z!

0:33:53.840,0:33:57.080
Oh God, this use of French pronunciation
in English-speaking commercials.

0:33:57.080,0:33:59.370
Advertising really is the closest vantage point

0:33:59.370,0:34:00.980
...from which we can peer into the abyss.

0:34:02.510,0:34:03.730
In the language of cinema,

0:34:03.730,0:34:05.470
...classical music is also sometimes used

0:34:05.470,0:34:07.990
...as an indication that a character is repressed.

0:34:07.990,0:34:09.860
For example, in the Hangover Part II,

0:34:09.860,0:34:12.640
...let’s look at the story arc
for this repressed character,

0:34:12.640,0:34:15.050
...which feels like it was
written on the back of a napkin.

0:34:15.050,0:34:16.280
Man getting married.

0:34:16.280,0:34:18.160
Dad of bride doesn’t like man.

0:34:18.160,0:34:19.230
Dad loves son,

0:34:19.230,0:34:20.390
...who classical be.

0:34:20.390,0:34:21.660
Bach Prelude in G,

0:34:21.660,0:34:23.200
...because… Of course.

0:34:23.200,0:34:24.450
Son repressed.

0:34:24.450,0:34:25.680
Party time!

0:34:25.680,0:34:27.340
Oh no, hangover happen.

0:34:27.340,0:34:28.060
Where son?

0:34:28.250,0:34:29.230
Search for son.

0:34:29.550,0:34:30.430
Search for son.

0:34:30.760,0:34:31.540
Son found!

0:34:31.820,0:34:32.800
Oh, no.

0:34:32.800,0:34:33.980
Son lose finger.

0:34:33.980,0:34:35.910
He no longer cello classical be.

0:34:35.910,0:34:38.060
But son not sad ‘cause liberated.

0:34:38.060,0:34:39.560
Hangover un-elitied him.

0:34:39.560,0:34:41.060
He happy normal now.

0:34:41.060,0:34:42.600
Take that, daddio!

0:34:46.270,0:34:49.230
'Britain’s Got Talent' have this
gimmick they pull fairly regularly,

0:34:49.230,0:34:51.190
...where a character comes out on stage

0:34:51.190,0:34:54.040
...and then begins performing on a boring old instrument,

0:34:54.040,0:34:54.920
...like a flute.

0:34:54.920,0:34:56.150
Everyone yawns.

0:34:56.150,0:34:57.530
So boring.

0:34:59.860,0:35:01.198

Aww, hold on!

0:35:02.310,0:35:03.810
He’s playing a crutch!

0:35:03.810,0:35:04.840
Awesome!

0:35:04.840,0:35:06.040
Now it’s good!

0:35:07.520,0:35:09.540
In Ireland, if you’re a student going to a party

0:35:09.540,0:35:10.610
...and you want to have a drink,

0:35:10.610,0:35:12.000
...but you’re super low on funds,

0:35:12.000,0:35:14.680
...the famous option of last
resort is a bottle of vodka

0:35:14.680,0:35:16.460
...sold by the German discount supermarket

0:35:16.460,0:35:18.030
'Lidl', or possibly ‘Leedle’,

0:35:18.030,0:35:19.750
...it’s a national debate how you pronounce it.

0:35:19.750,0:35:21.470
Anyway. all you’ll need is €10

0:35:21.470,0:35:22.770
...and a cast-iron stomach,

0:35:22.770,0:35:24.420
...because this stuff will test you beyond

0:35:24.420,0:35:25.890
...whatever you think your limits are,

0:35:25.890,0:35:26.590
What’s it called?

0:35:26.860,0:35:27.740
'Rachmaninoff'.

0:35:27.930,0:35:28.540
Why?

0:35:28.540,0:35:29.900
Because wine and spirit brands

0:35:29.900,0:35:31.480
...never intentionally look cheap,

0:35:31.480,0:35:34.350
...so the low end of the market needs
to double down on their brand identity

0:35:34.350,0:35:36.050
...to create the illusion of quality.

0:35:36.050,0:35:38.940
This then reassures the
alcohol-obsessed undergrads of Ireland

0:35:38.940,0:35:40.860
...that their choice isn’t utterly appalling.

0:35:40.860,0:35:43.598
But this stuff is about as far from
classy as you’re likely to get!

0:35:43.600,0:35:45.200
It tastes like you’re drinking leakage

0:35:45.200,0:35:47.110
...from Rachmaninoff’s decomposing corpse!

0:35:47.800,0:35:49.980
It’s not just misrepresentation from the outside

0:35:49.980,0:35:51.998
...that affects the perception of classical music.

0:35:52.000,0:35:54.470
The enemy is most certainly also within,

0:35:54.470,0:35:58.230
...because the problem with all this coding
of classical music as an elite artform

0:35:58.230,0:35:59.890
...is that it appeals to some people.

0:35:59.890,0:36:02.400
Some people like to think
of themselves as classy folk.

0:36:02.400,0:36:04.160
I mean, I could give loads of examples,

0:36:04.160,0:36:06.020
...but that would just delay
the moment until I mention

0:36:06.020,0:36:07.038
...André Rieu.

0:36:07.040,0:36:09.090
I cannot really wrap my head around this man.

0:36:09.090,0:36:10.850
His concerts are so odd.

0:36:10.850,0:36:12.940
It's mainly just a bunch of short fragments

0:36:12.940,0:36:15.510
...of the most clichéd pieces
from the classical repertoire.

0:36:15.510,0:36:17.400
If he’s doing Beethoven 9, for example.

0:36:17.400,0:36:18.660
...he won’t play the full thing.

0:36:18.930,0:36:20.220
Not even a single movement.

0:36:20.220,0:36:21.730
Although, I guess if there are no movements,

0:36:21.730,0:36:23.160
...then people can’t not clap.

0:36:23.160,0:36:24.770
So I don’t know, perhaps he’s onto something.

0:36:24.770,0:36:25.500
But anyway,

0:36:25.500,0:36:27.060
...all you get are these dull fragments

0:36:27.060,0:36:29.918
...of the most famous bit
from, say, the 'Ode to Joy',

0:36:29.920,0:36:31.670
...and then on to another cliched fragment

0:36:31.670,0:36:33.020
...from some another well known work.

0:36:33.020,0:36:34.720
But there’s a bizarre contradiction here.

0:36:34.720,0:36:35.560
On the one hand,

0:36:35.560,0:36:37.840
...this is clearly an attempt
to make classical music

0:36:37.840,0:36:39.310
...quote ‘accessible’ unquote,

0:36:39.310,0:36:40.310
...but on the other hand,

0:36:40.310,0:36:42.260
...look at the stage setup which is, like,

0:36:42.260,0:36:43.980
...Disney-level aristocratic.

0:36:43.980,0:36:45.340
I find this so strange.

0:36:45.340,0:36:46.640
He's ditched all the complexity,

0:36:46.640,0:36:48.450
...but kept all the trappings of wealth?

0:36:48.450,0:36:50.810
Literally selling that cheesy
illusion of classical music

0:36:50.810,0:36:52.510
...that exists in popular culture?

0:36:52.510,0:36:55.410
And I honestly cannot understand
what audiences get out of this.

0:36:55.410,0:36:57.020
I- I guess it’s just fun?

0:36:57.020,0:36:58.360
Dressing up in your Sunday best

0:36:58.360,0:37:00.318

0:37:00.320,0:37:01.950
I’m not even joking about that, by the way.

0:37:01.950,0:37:03.770
On the homepage of his website, it says:

0:37:12.990,0:37:13.540
I mean...

0:37:13.540,0:37:14.000
I-

0:37:14.350,0:37:14.800
Urgh.

0:37:15.150,0:37:15.790
Whatever.

0:37:26.580,0:37:28.158
And here’s a thought experiment.

0:37:28.160,0:37:30.760
Imagine a young person chancing upon this on TV.

0:37:30.760,0:37:32.280
With no prior experience,

0:37:32.280,0:37:34.110
...they’d be forgiven for concluding that

0:37:34.110,0:37:36.020
...this is what ‘classical music’ is:

0:37:36.020,0:37:36.820
‘distant’,

0:37:36.820,0:37:37.790
‘unreachable’,

0:37:37.790,0:37:39.300
‘old, white and rich’,

0:37:39.300,0:37:40.270
‘alien’,

0:37:40.270,0:37:41.340
'musically boring',

0:37:41.340,0:37:43.020
...and 'just awful'.

0:37:43.020,0:37:44.440
While what’s actually going on is that

0:37:44.440,0:37:46.630
...Andre is selling the image of elitism

0:37:46.630,0:37:48.050
...to non-classical audiences

0:37:48.050,0:37:51.140
...while ditching the musical substance
and essence of classical music.

0:37:51.140,0:37:52.570
It’s bourgeois cosplay.

0:37:52.570,0:37:55.130
For those invested in trying
to diversify classical music

0:37:55.130,0:37:56.470
...and modernise its image,

0:37:56.470,0:37:58.920
...this is an internal act of cultural terrorism!

0:38:04.080,0:38:07.100
The last thing I want to talk about
that really hurts the classical genre

0:38:07.100,0:38:10.550
...is the widespread perception that
it is the music of the middle class.

0:38:10.550,0:38:11.890
Now, as we’ve seen earlier,

0:38:11.890,0:38:13.140
...this is factually true,

0:38:13.140,0:38:15.830
...but it doesn’t have to be a
fait accompli for all eternity.

0:38:15.830,0:38:18.770
But despite all the hard work being
done to change this situation,

0:38:18.770,0:38:20.360
...there are those audience members who are

0:38:20.360,0:38:22.620
...doing their best to uphold the status quo,

0:38:22.620,0:38:24.580
...who get way too caught up with the identity

0:38:24.580,0:38:26.590
...that they think classical music confers on them,

0:38:26.590,0:38:28.360
...I would argue, largely informed by

0:38:28.360,0:38:31.690
...the commercialisation and reification
of classical music we have looked at.

0:38:31.690,0:38:33.600
These are the folk you’ll find tutting at people

0:38:33.600,0:38:35.320
...who clap between movements.

0:38:35.320,0:38:37.340
These are the people who complain on message boards

0:38:37.340,0:38:39.280
...about the riffraff who fail to dress up.

0:38:39.280,0:38:40.650

Y’know, show a bit of decorum,

0:38:50.070,0:38:51.190
...for Christ’s sake?

0:38:51.520,0:38:54.310
Concert halls themselves seem
strange to the uninitiated.

0:38:54.310,0:38:56.130
...almost hermetically sealed off from the

0:38:56.130,0:38:58.580
...‘outside’ world of day-to-day social concerns.

0:38:58.580,0:39:00.230
This was, of course, by design,

0:39:00.230,0:39:02.690
...so that audiences can enjoy music for music’s sake.

0:39:02.690,0:39:03.740
However, to some,

0:39:03.740,0:39:06.638
...especially those from non-white,
non-middle-class backgrounds,

0:39:06.640,0:39:08.720
...these spaces feel cold and unwelcoming.

0:39:08.720,0:39:12.030
Anna Bull likens the sonically-sealed
space of the concert hall to:

0:39:16.520,0:39:18.670
And it’s worth mentioning another statistic here.

0:39:18.670,0:39:20.360
In the U.K., people with degrees

0:39:20.360,0:39:23.510
...are six times more likely to listen
to classical music than those without.

0:39:23.510,0:39:26.250
And the point for me is not that
this is automatically a bad thing.

0:39:26.250,0:39:28.240
It’s that the association is toxic

0:39:28.240,0:39:31.990
...and leans into the cliché that
classical music is a signifier of refinement.

0:39:31.990,0:39:34.240
This is a problem because, as Anna Bull observes,

0:39:34.240,0:39:35.880
...it clashes with what she calls:

0:39:41.340,0:39:43.970
We saw this exactly in that Sex Pistols interview.

0:39:43.970,0:39:47.060
Classical music was the last thing
they wanted to be associated with.

0:39:47.060,0:39:48.430
So all this stuff together,

0:39:48.430,0:39:49.730
...the economic barriers,

0:39:49.730,0:39:52.570
...the high representation of
professional, middle-class listeners,

0:39:52.570,0:39:54.110
...the weird social codes.

0:39:54.110,0:39:56.398
...the preference for cold, formal listening spaces.

0:39:56.400,0:39:57.200
Then add to that

0:39:57.200,0:40:00.360
...the crass commercialisation and
fetishisation of classical music

0:40:00.360,0:40:02.020
...as a way of tarting up a product

0:40:02.020,0:40:03.930
...or marking a character as dislikable.

0:40:03.930,0:40:04.960
It all adds up.

0:40:05.190,0:40:07.980
And the only thing I can think of
that we can do to stop it is...

0:40:08.340,0:40:09.200
...well, this.

0:40:09.420,0:40:10.390
Talk about it.

0:40:10.390,0:40:12.920
Identify it, and then take
little steps everywhere we can

0:40:12.920,0:40:14.350
...to break these clichés,

0:40:14.350,0:40:16.150
...be more inviting and fun for others.

0:40:16.150,0:40:17.230
Do our best to describe

0:40:17.230,0:40:19.330
...why long-form, and often challenging, music

0:40:19.330,0:40:20.790
...can be rewarding and exciting.

0:40:20.790,0:40:22.750
And don't get too bothered if people don’t care.

0:40:22.750,0:40:25.510
Redesign musical education to
not be so backwards-looking.

...against their non-diegetic soundtrack choices.

0:40:35.520,0:40:37.240
And we should also take the hard road too:

0:40:37.240,0:40:38.510
showing how we’re not elitist

0:40:38.510,0:40:40.420
...by responding with warmth and empathy

0:40:40.420,0:40:42.740
...rather than hostility whenever we’re criticised.

0:40:42.740,0:40:43.490
And then,

0:40:43.490,0:40:44.220
...possibly,

0:40:44.220,0:40:45.920
...we may develop a genre that sheds

0:40:45.920,0:40:48.078
...the nasty aspects of the classical legacy

0:40:48.080,0:40:50.240
...without completely losing sight of why it is

0:40:50.240,0:40:52.340
...still a really exciting art form.

0:41:07.840,0:41:08.920
In 1958,

0:41:08.920,0:41:10.280
...a now infamous article

0:41:10.280,0:41:12.400
...appeared in a journal called ‘High Fidelity’.

0:41:12.400,0:41:14.958
It was written by the American
composer Milton Babbitt,

0:41:14.960,0:41:18.240
...who was also a music and mathematics
professor at Princeton University.

0:41:18.240,0:41:19.320
The article was titled:

0:41:21.170,0:41:23.120
...and we’ll return to that title in a moment.

0:41:23.120,0:41:24.580
But a bit of background first.

0:41:24.580,0:41:26.120
Babbitt was involved in developing

0:41:26.120,0:41:29.370
...what is now referred to as
‘integral’ or ‘total serialism’,

0:41:29.370,0:41:32.480
...which was a highly complex expansion
of the ideas of Arnold Schoenberg.

0:41:32.480,0:41:35.100
Now, it’s worth mentioning that even to his admirers,

0:41:35.100,0:41:37.000
...Babbitt’s music is hard work.

0:41:37.000,0:41:39.700

0:41:48.980,0:41:49.440
"No!"

0:41:49.440,0:41:52.490
MARTIN (narrating):
Babbitt was becoming increasingly frustrated by two things.

0:41:52.490,0:41:54.080
First, he felt that the role of composer

0:41:54.080,0:41:55.918
...was not respected enough in academia,

0:41:55.920,0:41:58.410
...which considered music to be
more of a public commodity

0:41:58.410,0:42:00.090
...than a serious form of research.

0:42:00.090,0:42:01.960
Second, Babbitt very much disliked

0:42:01.960,0:42:03.620
...the inherited concert hall tradition,

0:42:03.620,0:42:07.210
...where audiences accustomed to the more
conventional music of Beethoven or Mahler,

0:42:07.210,0:42:09.770
...and who would have no idea
what integral serialism was,

0:42:09.770,0:42:11.700
...would be completely unprepared for his music

0:42:11.700,0:42:14.180
...and would often react with open hostility to it.

0:42:14.180,0:42:15.610
And so, in his article,

0:42:15.610,0:42:17.400
...he put forward the following argument.

0:42:17.720,0:42:18.830
First, he acknowledged

0:42:18.830,0:42:20.660
...that his music was inaccessible

0:42:20.660,0:42:22.750
...and pointed out that it required musical training

0:42:22.750,0:42:24.730
...and knowledge of musical history to appreciate,

0:42:24.730,0:42:27.290
...and made the case that this
should not be considered a bad thing.

0:42:27.630,0:42:28.850
Second, he acknowledged

0:42:28.850,0:42:30.980
...that unprepared listeners could not reasonably

0:42:30.980,0:42:32.500
...be expected to like his music,

0:42:32.500,0:42:34.760
...but were not justified when
they reacted with hostility.

0:42:35.050,0:42:36.340
And his appeal was this:

0:42:36.340,0:42:38.910
my music may not be popular
in a concert hall setting,

0:42:38.910,0:42:40.450
...but it is valuable as research,

0:42:40.450,0:42:42.460
...because it seeks to advance
the boundaries of music

0:42:42.460,0:42:44.370
...by exploring sonorities and structures

0:42:44.370,0:42:46.220
...outside the common point of reference,

0:42:46.220,0:42:47.640
...unbound from the need to cater to

0:42:47.640,0:42:49.680
...the limited understanding of the casual listener.

0:42:49.680,0:42:51.300
And he points out that this state of affairs

0:42:51.300,0:42:54.250
...is generally accepted in many
other forms of academic research.

0:43:06.750,0:43:08.520
There were three kinds of responses to this.

0:43:08.770,0:43:11.610
Some hated the idea that a composer
would encourage his colleagues

0:43:11.610,0:43:13.490
...to abandon the wider listening audience

0:43:13.490,0:43:15.180
...and retreat into academia.

0:43:15.180,0:43:17.550
Some saw it as a defensive lashing-out at listeners

0:43:17.550,0:43:18.750
...for not liking his music.

0:43:18.750,0:43:20.060
More about that in a second.

0:43:20.060,0:43:22.910
Others still were irritated by
Babbitt’s positioning of his work

0:43:22.910,0:43:24.480
...as an ‘advancement’ of music at all.

0:43:24.870,0:43:27.140
Now, I have some sympathy for Milton’s position here.

0:43:27.370,0:43:30.760
In particular, I think he is right to
defend complexity and inaccessibility

0:43:30.760,0:43:32.090
...against what can sometimes be

0:43:32.090,0:43:34.380
...an overbearing insistence among audience members

0:43:34.380,0:43:36.318
...that music should do what they want it to do.

0:43:36.320,0:43:38.430
It’s a kind of ‘the customer’s always right’ attitude

0:43:38.430,0:43:40.860
...that refuses to engage with an alien point of view.

0:43:40.860,0:43:42.640
By telling someone what they should be saying,

0:43:42.640,0:43:43.580
...you’re not listening.

0:43:43.920,0:43:45.090
But, that said, there are

0:43:45.090,0:43:46.718
...two big problems with this article:

0:43:46.720,0:43:47.810
First, the name.

0:43:47.810,0:43:48.950
Now, as we’ve seen,

0:43:48.950,0:43:50.110
...the intended title was

0:43:50.110,0:43:51.910
‘The composer as specialist’.

0:43:51.910,0:43:53.730
The published title, however, was:

0:43:56.010,0:43:57.118
And as you can imagine,

0:43:57.120,0:43:59.050
...this hostile name is one of the main reasons

0:43:59.050,0:44:01.118
...why the article got as much notice as it did.

0:44:01.120,0:44:02.670
But this name was actually a change

0:44:02.670,0:44:04.250
...made by the editor of 'High Fidelity'

0:44:04.250,0:44:05.730
...without Babbitt’s consent.

0:44:05.730,0:44:07.090
The second problem is Milton’s

0:44:07.090,0:44:09.320
...not-amazingly-well-concealed bitterness.

0:44:09.320,0:44:11.890
And it’s this aspect of the
essay that makes it, for me,

0:44:11.890,0:44:13.250
...a little whinge-y in tone,

0:44:13.250,0:44:14.930
...but also actually quite funny too.

0:44:14.930,0:44:16.230
I mean, take this bit for example:

0:44:37.700,0:44:38.790
"Imagine, if you can,"

0:44:38.790,0:44:40.730
"...a layman chancing upon a lecture on"

0:44:40.730,0:44:43.010
"...'Pointwise Periodic Homeomorphisms'."

0:44:43.010,0:44:44.000
"At the conclusion,"

0:44:44.000,0:44:45.930
"...he announces, 'I didn’t like it.'"

0:44:45.930,0:44:48.470
"Social conventions being
what they are in such circles,"

0:44:48.470,0:44:50.920
"...someone might dare inquire, 'Why not?'"

0:44:50.920,0:44:52.770
"Under duress, our layman discloses"

0:44:52.770,0:44:55.210
"...precise reasons for his
failure to enjoy himself."

0:44:55.210,0:44:56.630
"He found the hall chilly,"

0:44:56.630,0:44:58.220
"...the lecturer’s voice unpleasant,"

0:44:58.220,0:45:01.090
"...and he was suffering the
digestive aftermath of a poor dinner."

0:45:01.090,0:45:03.890
"His interlocutor understandably
disqualifies these reasons"

0:45:03.890,0:45:06.570
"...as irrelevant to the content
and value of the lecture,"

0:45:06.570,0:45:09.050
"...and the development of
mathematics is left undisturbed."

0:45:09.050,0:45:10.660
STEVE: "You dirty bastard."

0:45:10.660,0:45:11.580
MARTIN (narrating):
Oh, I don’t know.

0:45:11.580,0:45:13.940
From time to time, it’s just fun to
just listen to a passionate person

0:45:13.940,0:45:15.180
...go on a bit of a tirade.

0:45:15.180,0:45:16.880
The- There’s another moment
where he points out that

0:45:16.880,0:45:18.330
...if his music didn’t exist,

0:45:18.330,0:45:19.710
...barely anyone would notice.

0:45:19.710,0:45:21.000
But rather than write this in a way

0:45:21.000,0:45:23.390
...that might appear self-reflective and honest,

0:45:23.390,0:45:24.210
...he wrote instead:

0:45:38.760,0:45:39.850
MARTIN (narrating):
Oh, no. Don’t say that!

0:45:39.850,0:45:42.490
Don’t say that if you don’t get
special funding, music will die.

0:45:42.490,0:45:43.660
STEVE: [extremely slowed-down and pitch-shifted]
"Bastard."

0:45:43.660,0:45:44.500
MARTIN (narrating):
Oh. [laughs] I'm sorry,

0:45:44.500,0:45:45.950
...I just find this article really funny.

0:45:46.320,0:45:47.490
But poor MBabb!

0:45:47.490,0:45:49.320
By his own admission, he’s now best known,

0:45:49.320,0:45:51.450
...not as a composer, but as the author of:

0:45:52.780,0:45:53.830
...which is unfortunate.

0:45:53.830,0:45:54.870
With a different title

0:45:54.870,0:45:57.030
...and a little more context and less bitterness,

0:45:57.030,0:45:59.420
...it probably would have
Passed relatively unnoticed.

0:46:12.960,0:46:14.630
‘Gatekeeping’ is a term that permeates

0:46:14.630,0:46:16.330
...the majority of disputes about music.

0:46:16.890,0:46:19.070
It’s typified by these kinds of phrases:

0:46:26.080,0:46:28.420
The reason these statements bug people is obvious.

0:46:28.420,0:46:29.678
If you find music you like,

0:46:29.680,0:46:31.040
...these kinds of comments make you feel

0:46:31.040,0:46:33.118
...your enjoyment is somehow inferior.

0:46:33.120,0:46:35.040
I don’t think this requires much expanding on.

0:46:35.040,0:46:36.460
No one likes being talked to this way.

0:46:36.880,0:46:38.780
And there’s one thing in particular I want to discuss

0:46:38.780,0:46:42.120
...that I think gets to the root of what
many people consider to be gatekeeping.

0:46:42.500,0:46:43.620
It’s what I’m going to call:

0:46:45.140,0:46:48.240
A video released last year by
the YouTuber 'Timbah.On.Toast'

0:46:48.240,0:46:50.590
...exemplifies the power of the imposter phenomenon.

0:46:50.590,0:46:51.380
It’s called:

0:46:53.160,0:46:53.950
In this video,

0:46:53.950,0:46:56.520
...he describes his experience as a teenager in London,

0:46:56.520,0:46:59.130
...just as the dubstep genre was beginning to take hold.

0:46:59.130,0:47:00.800
You should really watch it. It’s fantastic.

0:47:01.080,0:47:02.900
He describes how he first got sucked into

0:47:02.900,0:47:06.090
...the artistic, slowed-down,
ambient quality of early dubstep,

0:47:06.090,0:47:08.930
...and how he watched with joy as
it began to spread across London.

0:47:08.930,0:47:11.480
How performances were minimalistic with no bling,

0:47:11.480,0:47:12.360
...no bro-manship,

0:47:12.360,0:47:13.850
...and no pretentiousness at all.

0:47:13.850,0:47:15.260
People just turned up to shows,

0:47:15.260,0:47:16.420
...stood there and listened.

0:47:16.420,0:47:19.250
He describes how this scene was
a refuge for him and his friends,

0:47:19.250,0:47:21.918
...a community of their own that
he actively participated in.

0:47:21.920,0:47:24.070
Then he described how, as the genre evolved,

0:47:24.070,0:47:26.860
...a more punchy, dance-friendly variant began to emerge

0:47:26.860,0:47:30.280
...that eventually led to the famous
'womp-womp', 'screech' sound we all know.

0:47:30.560,0:47:32.940
He describes how DJs gradually began including

0:47:32.940,0:47:34.590
...more and more of this style in their sets

0:47:34.590,0:47:36.390
...to encourage audiences to go wild,

0:47:36.390,0:47:38.160
...and how he liked this development at first

0:47:38.160,0:47:40.170
...until he began to notice that it was taking over,

0:47:40.170,0:47:41.850
...changing the entire dynamic of shows,

0:47:41.850,0:47:44.150
...which became more and more about crazy dancing

0:47:44.150,0:47:45.740
...and less about detached listening.

0:47:45.740,0:47:47.990
And as DJs continued trying to outdo each other,

0:47:47.990,0:47:50.170
...it became an arms race that completely drowned out

0:47:50.170,0:47:52.238
...the quieter, ambient, artistic stuff.

0:47:52.240,0:47:53.740
And then he talks about Skrillex,

0:47:53.740,0:47:56.120
...who, inspired by this new strain of Dubstep,

0:47:56.120,0:47:58.510
...ramped it up to be even more blunt and harsh,

0:47:58.510,0:48:01.180
...and in doing so, reached massive commercial success.

0:48:01.180,0:48:03.000
This brought in a completely new audience

0:48:03.000,0:48:05.120
...who considered Skrillex to be a figurehead.

0:48:05.120,0:48:07.180
And so dubstep was utterly redefined,

0:48:07.180,0:48:09.440
...carrying little of the spirit of the community

0:48:09.440,0:48:10.700
...that Timbah was a part of.

0:48:10.700,0:48:11.930
And he resented this.

0:48:11.930,0:48:14.620
He felt it dispossessed him of
the scene that he grew up with.

0:48:14.620,0:48:16.790
A feeling shared by many people around the U.K.

0:48:16.790,0:48:18.860
...who remembered dubstep as something else,

0:48:18.860,0:48:20.078
...who, in their frustration,

0:48:20.080,0:48:22.650
...lashed out at U.S.' dubstep for being commercial,

0:48:22.650,0:48:23.860
...inartistic and dumb.

0:48:23.860,0:48:25.730
Many people refer to this as ‘gate-keeping’,

0:48:25.730,0:48:27.140
...but I think it goes much deeper.

0:48:27.140,0:48:29.330
I think of it more as a kind of misdirected sadness

0:48:29.330,0:48:31.490
...at the loss of one’s own community and identity.

0:48:31.490,0:48:33.438
To give one quote from a dubstep forum:

0:48:51.840,0:48:53.050
And this way of looking at things

0:48:53.050,0:48:55.020
...helps us when considering other genres.

0:48:55.020,0:48:56.330
For example, jazz,

0:48:56.330,0:48:57.540
...the genre that suffers

0:48:57.540,0:49:01.010
...from what is probably the most famous
example of the imposter phenomenon:

0:49:01.010,0:49:01.918
Kenny G.

0:49:01.920,0:49:04.270
His music is a common joke even in mass media,

0:49:04.270,0:49:06.190
...generally considered to be overly safe

0:49:06.190,0:49:08.250
...and lacking in any artistic depth,

0:49:08.250,0:49:10.318
...the choice of shopping malls around the world.

0:49:10.320,0:49:11.300
NORM: Kenny G

0:49:11.300,0:49:13.360
...has a Christmas album out this year.

0:49:13.940,0:49:15.570
Hey! Happy birthday, Jesus.

0:49:15.830,0:49:17.140
I hope you like crap!

0:49:17.140,0:49:18.180
[audience laughing]

0:49:18.180,0:49:20.020
And it’s this pervasive sense of Kenny G as

0:49:20.020,0:49:22.200
...flat, uninteresting, aeroplane food

0:49:22.200,0:49:25.620
...that made his association with
jazz so troubling for some musicians.

0:49:25.620,0:49:27.330
Because if enough people had come to think

0:49:27.330,0:49:28.960
...that jazz is the sound of Kenny G,

0:49:28.960,0:49:31.230
...and enough new musicians had piled into the genre

0:49:31.230,0:49:33.020
...to replicate Kenny G’s success,

0:49:33.020,0:49:35.200
...then jazz itself would slowly be redefined.

0:49:35.200,0:49:36.620
Its legacy and history,

0:49:36.620,0:49:37.820
...unknown to this new audience,

0:49:37.820,0:49:38.800
...would fade away.

0:49:38.800,0:49:40.330
And for some listeners or performers

0:49:40.330,0:49:42.200
...whose identities are caught up with jazz,

0:49:42.200,0:49:43.380
...that was a scary prospect,

0:49:43.380,0:49:45.450
...and many hit out to prevent it from happening.

0:49:45.450,0:49:48.798
Take the famous overreaction of
the jazz guitarist Pat Metheny,

0:49:48.800,0:49:50.510
...who took issue with Kenny G performing

0:49:50.510,0:49:52.718
...alongside footage of the late Louis Armstrong:

0:50:14.320,0:50:16.180
Metheny also spends time discussing

0:50:16.180,0:50:19.180
...whether Kenny G’s music can
even really be said to be jazz.

0:50:19.180,0:50:21.120
"And now that’s what people think jazz is."

0:50:21.120,0:50:23.278
"Well, that’s not what jazz is, at all."

0:50:23.280,0:50:24.960
And to me, that’s the real message:

0:50:24.960,0:50:28.760
Metheny wants to reinforce the history
and meaning of jazz as much as he can

0:50:28.760,0:50:31.118
...because he perceives Kenny G to be a threat to it,

0:50:31.120,0:50:33.390
...which in turn is a threat to him and his identity.

0:50:33.390,0:50:35.290
I think it’s a completely understandable fear.

0:50:35.290,0:50:37.390
Mass media can completely change perceptions

0:50:37.390,0:50:39.860
...and history can be forgotten if it isn’t passed down.

0:50:39.860,0:50:42.960
Not that that justifies Metheny’s
hyperbolic, mean-spirited delivery.

0:50:43.520,0:50:45.850
Speaking for myself, being a contemporary composer,

0:50:45.850,0:50:47.358
...I have a somewhat similar feeling

0:50:47.360,0:50:49.390
...about the music of Ludovico Einaudi,

0:50:49.390,0:50:51.100
...a man who is, in many respects,

0:50:51.100,0:50:52.910
...the Kenny G of the classical world.

0:50:52.920,0:50:55.370
Now, none of what I’m about to
say is particularly justifiable,

0:50:55.370,0:50:56.420
...so bear with me.

0:50:56.420,0:50:59.240
The only difference for me between Kenny G and Einaudi

0:50:59.240,0:51:01.118
...is that Kenny G has a sound.

0:51:01.120,0:51:02.870
With Einaudi, I can’t really detect

0:51:02.870,0:51:05.240
...any artistry or identifiable voice at all.

0:51:05.240,0:51:06.520
Even the titles of his songs

0:51:06.520,0:51:07.930
...just scream low-effort to me:

0:51:18.080,0:51:19.110
And I’m not alone.

0:51:19.110,0:51:21.350
It’s not a secret that many ‘classical music’ listeners

0:51:21.350,0:51:22.980
...have no time for Einaudi.

0:51:22.980,0:51:24.610
And I’m pretty sure that the main reason for this

0:51:24.610,0:51:26.540
...is because they see him as an imposter.

0:51:26.540,0:51:27.740
Someone who threatens,

0:51:27.740,0:51:29.460
...due to his success and mass appeal,

0:51:29.460,0:51:31.940
...to redefine the classical genre as a kind of

0:51:31.940,0:51:34.060
...non-experimental, bland, elevator music.

0:51:34.330,0:51:35.290
For me personally,

0:51:35.290,0:51:37.760
...the identity threat from
Einaudi is not exactly that.

0:51:37.760,0:51:38.610
It’s a bit different.

0:51:38.880,0:51:40.740
What I value in music is originality,

0:51:40.740,0:51:41.830
...experimentation,

0:51:41.830,0:51:44.270
...and a resistance to mass-media homogenisation,

0:51:44.270,0:51:46.030
...and Einaudi’s music is, to me,

0:51:46.030,0:51:48.840
...the purest distillation of
the opposite of those qualities.

0:51:49.180,0:51:51.670
So, I see his incredible success as a sign

0:51:51.670,0:51:53.540
...that an ever increasing number of people

0:51:53.540,0:51:55.220
...don’t care about what I care about.

0:51:55.220,0:51:58.620
This is a purely emotional reaction
based on a perspective that I have,

0:51:58.620,0:52:01.438
...which makes his music seem
so much more objectionable to me

0:52:01.440,0:52:02.850
...than it does to many other people.

0:52:02.850,0:52:05.970
As I said, I can’t really
justify it in any serious way.

0:52:05.970,0:52:08.180
But being able to justify it isn’t the point.

0:52:08.180,0:52:10.260
The point is that the imposter phenomenon is

0:52:10.260,0:52:11.880
...very emotionally understandable

0:52:11.880,0:52:13.190
...and easy to empathise with,

0:52:13.190,0:52:16.200
...and I think it’s very often the
reason why people make statements like

0:52:16.200,0:52:17.780
"I liked it before it was popular",

0:52:17.780,0:52:19.230
"I prefer the early stuff",

0:52:19.230,0:52:21.400
"The scene was great before it became commercial".

0:52:21.840,0:52:23.630
You don’t deal with these kinds of positions

0:52:23.630,0:52:25.010
...by hammering them with iron logic.

0:52:25.390,0:52:27.510
You don’t deal with them by
shouting at them on Twitter.

0:52:28.070,0:52:28.830
You deal with them

0:52:28.830,0:52:30.770
...by recognising their sense of threat.

In 1966,

0:52:56.480,0:52:59.250
...the fate of the Chinese people
was about to take a dark turn.

0:52:59.520,0:53:00.850
Their leader, Mao Zedong,

0:53:00.850,0:53:02.810
...a man whose policies had unnecessarily

0:53:02.810,0:53:04.930
...caused the largest famine in human history,

0:53:04.930,0:53:07.020
...(doing away with) between 20-40 million people,

0:53:07.020,0:53:09.200
...was about to attempt a massive undertaking.

0:53:09.450,0:53:10.540
His plan, called

0:53:10.540,0:53:12.878
...the ‘Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution’,

0:53:12.880,0:53:15.180
...was an attempt to completely reset society.

0:53:15.180,0:53:16.950
And a large part of this plan included

0:53:16.950,0:53:19.830
...the elimination of all
historical and foreign influences,

0:53:19.830,0:53:21.380
...in particular Confucianism

0:53:21.380,0:53:22.840
...and anything from the West,

0:53:22.840,0:53:25.990
...both of which Mao considered to be
the cause of China’s historical problems.

0:53:26.360,0:53:28.630
However, his number one focus was to eliminate

0:53:28.630,0:53:31.570
...all vestiges of what he saw as 'bourgeois elitism',

0:53:31.570,0:53:33.970
...which he believed was perpetuated through education.

0:53:33.970,0:53:36.840
So, China’s education system was completely dismantled,

0:53:36.840,0:53:39.010
...with all its schools and universities shut.

0:53:39.010,0:53:40.050
Teachers, scientists,

0:53:40.050,0:53:42.800
...and anyone else considered to be a
member of the intellectual bourgeois

0:53:42.800,0:53:44.158
...were routinely beaten,

0:53:44.160,0:53:44.720
...interred,

0:53:45.540,0:53:46.690
...publicly humiliated,

0:53:46.690,0:53:48.640
...harassed into ending their own lives, or:

0:53:49.540,0:53:51.500
All music prior to the Cultural Revolution

0:53:51.500,0:53:53.730
...was considered fundamentally contaminated.

0:53:54.020,0:53:56.130
China’s indigenous traditional music was deemed

0:53:56.130,0:53:58.930
...a hopelessly old-fashioned remnant of feudal culture.

0:53:58.930,0:54:01.730
The ideas of Confucius on music were completely rejected

0:54:01.730,0:54:03.100
...and his writings outlawed.

0:54:03.100,0:54:05.960
Mao even went as far as to blow up Confucius’s tomb.

0:54:05.960,0:54:07.930
Western classical music was deemed to be

0:54:07.930,0:54:09.140
...completely contaminated

0:54:09.140,0:54:11.340
...due its history of aristocratic patronage,

0:54:11.340,0:54:12.330
...and was outlawed,

0:54:12.330,0:54:14.870
...and those who taught Western
classical music at conservatories

0:54:14.870,0:54:16.720
...were treated with incredible harshness:

0:54:16.720,0:54:19.370
SHUZHEN: Ten of our teachers died from, uh,

0:54:19.370,0:54:20.100
...from by [sic]:

0:54:21.490,0:54:22.880
...because they couldn't

0:54:22.880,0:54:24.840
...stand the humiliation and:

0:54:26.630,0:54:27.230
...especially the:

0:54:27.530,0:54:28.420
...of the mind.

0:54:29.030,0:54:31.970
MARTIN (narrating):
Official media from this period
described Beethoven as a

0:54:31.970,0:54:33.720
“German capitalist composer”,

0:54:33.720,0:54:34.350
...whose work:

0:54:36.820,0:54:37.970
...whatever that means.

0:54:37.970,0:54:39.970
Writing about the Western classical tradition,

0:54:39.970,0:54:42.400
...the then-culture-minister, Yu Huiyong wrote:

0:54:48.950,0:54:52.530
So, by dubiously linking classical
music to Confucius in this way,

0:54:52.530,0:54:53.880
...the government under Mao created

0:54:53.880,0:54:56.010
...a grand elitist conspiracy in music

0:54:56.010,0:54:57.810
...so they could position themselves as the ones

0:54:57.810,0:54:59.330
...who would finally sweep it away.

0:54:59.330,0:55:01.260
The ambition here is kind of astounding.

0:55:01.260,0:55:04.670
Mao understood that music was a
key aspect in identity formation.

0:55:04.670,0:55:06.000
He wanted to avoid a future

0:55:06.000,0:55:08.300
...where a band like the ‘Sex Pistols’ could exist.

0:55:08.300,0:55:09.750
So, since he believed that

0:55:09.750,0:55:11.780
...all music was associated with class,

0:55:11.780,0:55:13.820
...and he wanted to build a classless society,

0:55:13.820,0:55:16.400
...banning all prior music up
to that point wasn’t enough.

0:55:16.400,0:55:19.518
He had to wipe the entire history
of music out of existence too.

0:55:19.520,0:55:20.940
And you can see the logic here.

0:55:20.940,0:55:23.370
Everything I’ve described in
this video up until now has shown

0:55:23.370,0:55:25.560
...that elitism in music is completely entwined

0:55:25.560,0:55:28.158
...with history, class division and education.

0:55:28.160,0:55:30.230
So this is one way that someone has tried to answer

0:55:30.230,0:55:33.120
...the original question I posed at
the very beginning of this video,

0:55:33.450,0:55:35.040
'how do we end elitism in music'.

0:55:35.400,0:55:36.360
Mao’s answer?

0:55:36.360,0:55:39.460
Completely wipe everyone’s memory of
everything that has ever happened,

0:55:39.460,0:55:40.700
...and start from scratch.

0:55:40.700,0:55:42.130
And even this didn’t work.

0:55:42.480,0:55:43.130
Why?

0:55:43.130,0:55:45.180
Because many musicians secretly continued

0:55:45.180,0:55:48.250
...to practice traditional and
classical music behind closed doors,

0:55:48.250,0:55:49.680
...at great personal risk.

0:55:50.560,0:55:52.260
The Cultural Revolution came to an end

0:55:52.260,0:55:54.150
...with Mao’s death in 1976,

0:55:54.410,0:55:57.370
...the same year, incidentally, that
the Sex Pistols gave that interview.

0:55:57.700,0:55:59.570
His successor, Deng Xiaoping,

0:55:59.570,0:56:01.270
...reopened schools and universities,

0:56:01.540,0:56:04.440
...and those people who had been
practising classical music in secret

0:56:04.440,0:56:07.350
...now emerged to teach the next generation of musicians.

0:56:07.350,0:56:10.020
Shortly after, China began to reopen to the world.

0:56:10.020,0:56:13.100
The American violinist Isaac Stern
was invited to tour China,

0:56:13.100,0:56:15.940
...where he visited music halls
and institutions around the country,

0:56:15.940,0:56:18.570
...meeting hundreds of children
who’d perform for him along the way.

0:56:18.790,0:56:19.598
At one point,

0:56:19.600,0:56:21.880
...he raised a question about
the talents of these children,

0:56:21.880,0:56:23.630
...asking, a little clumsily,

0:56:23.630,0:56:25.860
...why the younger children aged 7 to 11

0:56:25.860,0:56:27.160
...showed so much more promise

0:56:27.160,0:56:29.440
...than the older children aged 17 and above.

0:56:29.440,0:56:30.880
ISAAC: "...the young people,"

0:56:31.300,0:56:32.720
"...8, 9, 10, 11..."

0:56:34.100,0:56:35.050
"...remarkable."

0:56:35.050,0:56:37.480
"But 17, 18, 19, 20, 21,"

0:56:37.480,0:56:38.760
"...something happened to them."

0:56:38.760,0:56:39.950
"What happened in between?"

0:56:39.950,0:56:41.160
MARTIN (narrating):
And then someone explained to him,

0:56:41.580,0:56:43.840
...those aged 17 and above didn’t study music

0:56:43.840,0:56:45.210
...because for most of their lives,

0:56:45.210,0:56:46.620
...education was illegal.

0:56:46.870,0:56:47.770
Regardless,

0:56:47.770,0:56:50.050
...Isaac’s visit caused a massive stir in China

0:56:50.050,0:56:52.180
...and was one of the events
that led to a gigantic surge

0:56:52.180,0:56:54.320
...of enthusiasm for Western classical music

0:56:54.320,0:56:55.850
...that continues to this day,

0:56:55.850,0:56:58.080
...aided in large part by the Communist party,

0:56:58.080,0:57:00.318
...who, completely reversing the position of Mao,

0:57:00.320,0:57:02.710
...have invested gigantic sums into its cultivation

0:57:02.710,0:57:04.660
...through arts funding and venue construction

0:57:04.660,0:57:06.560
...that dwarfs anything seen in the West.

0:57:06.880,0:57:09.320
And as a result of this combination of organic influence

0:57:09.320,0:57:10.850
...and massive state funding,

0:57:10.850,0:57:13.680
...China is the only place in the world
where classical music is growing,

0:57:13.680,0:57:16.380
...being practiced by an estimated 100 million people.

0:57:16.730,0:57:17.810
China has, for a while now,

0:57:17.810,0:57:20.210
...been the largest consumer and exporter of instruments,

0:57:20.210,0:57:22.020
...in particular the violin and piano.

0:57:22.300,0:57:25.200
This is an incredible cultural U-turn
that’s a little hard to explain,

0:57:25.200,0:57:28.080
...and there are certainly different
perspectives on why it has happened:

0:57:28.320,0:57:29.830
The conductor, Li Delun,

0:57:29.830,0:57:32.610
...one of the champions of the
classical revival in China, argued:

0:57:37.920,0:57:40.060
Another influence comes from Confucianism,

0:57:40.060,0:57:41.760
...which has been completely revived in China

0:57:41.760,0:57:43.840
...and embraced by the Communist Party of today,

0:57:43.840,0:57:45.340
...who, after 40 years in power,

0:57:45.340,0:57:47.040
...see less advantage in Mao’s

0:57:47.040,0:57:49.400
...‘tear everything to shreds’ revolutionary spirit

0:57:49.400,0:57:51.820
...and a lot more advantage in the Confucian emphasis

0:57:51.820,0:57:54.590
...on harmonious society and respect for authority.

0:57:54.960,0:57:56.620
And similar to Confucian thinking,

0:57:56.620,0:57:58.020
...there are those in the Communist party

0:57:58.020,0:58:01.240
...who have encouraged the widespread
adoption of Western classical music

0:58:01.240,0:58:03.730
...as a means of directing the shape that society takes.

0:58:04.140,0:58:05.120
To give one example,

0:58:05.120,0:58:06.130
...in 1994,

0:58:06.130,0:58:08.040
...the then-President, Jiang Zemin,

0:58:08.040,0:58:10.290
...conceived of music appreciation classes,

0:58:10.290,0:58:13.280
...which emphasised the value of
classical music over pop music,

0:58:13.280,0:58:13.910
...because:

0:58:17.030,0:58:18.170
But there are those in China

0:58:18.170,0:58:20.680
...who do not see these developments in such a rosy light.

0:58:21.140,0:58:23.400
Commenting on the obsession with Western classical music

0:58:23.400,0:58:25.830
...and how it is linked to the ideas of Confucius,

0:58:25.830,0:58:27.480
...the musician Wu Han said:

0:58:39.270,0:58:40.920
And what strikes me about all of this

0:58:40.920,0:58:42.720
...is how much the appreciation of music

0:58:42.720,0:58:45.440
...is impossibly entwined with a history of leadership

0:58:45.440,0:58:47.120
...that has attempted to harness it as a tool

0:58:47.120,0:58:49.250
...to mould society into a shape of their liking.

0:58:49.250,0:58:50.320
Yet, at the same time,

0:58:50.320,0:58:52.020
...you can't possibly argue that there isn’t also

0:58:52.020,0:58:54.940
...a profound love of Western
classical music mixed in there too.

0:58:54.940,0:58:58.220
Those who practised it in secret for
10 years during the Cultural Revolution

0:58:58.220,0:58:59.880
...are more than enough proof of that.

0:58:59.880,0:59:02.890
And the fact that the Cultural Revolution
itself was a complete failure

0:59:02.890,0:59:05.930
...is also proof that there is a limit to
how much the people can be brainwashed.

0:59:06.480,0:59:09.750
China and the West have more similarities
than differences when it comes to music,

0:59:09.750,0:59:11.650
...but the differences are fascinating.

0:59:11.650,0:59:13.180
China’s history of music is like

0:59:13.180,0:59:15.850
...an alternate dimension that
the West can compare itself to,

0:59:15.850,0:59:17.730
...where some ideas grew stronger there

0:59:17.730,0:59:19.780
...that failed to influence as much here.

0:59:19.780,0:59:22.290
For example, our own revered philosopher, Plato,

0:59:22.290,0:59:24.230
...made a very similar case to Confucius

0:59:24.230,0:59:26.050
...about how music should be safeguarded

0:59:26.050,0:59:28.110
...to preserve the moral character of the people.

0:59:28.110,0:59:30.400
But these were largely thrown out by Aristotle,

0:59:30.400,0:59:32.980
...who emphasised the importance of observable experience

0:59:32.980,0:59:34.930
...over unprovable concepts of

0:59:34.930,0:59:37.610
...a musical spiritual connection to the cosmos.

0:59:37.610,0:59:38.350
So today,

0:59:38.350,0:59:41.650
...the main proponents of the
Platonic-Confucian ideal of music in the West

0:59:41.650,0:59:44.420
...are largely relegated to New Age conspiracy theories,

0:59:44.420,0:59:46.490
...like the 'A=432' crowd

0:59:46.490,0:59:48.540
...or the wonderfully well researched classic

0:59:48.540,0:59:50.220
‘The Secret Power of Music’.

1:00:02.080,1:00:03.390
As I mentioned at the outset,

1:00:03.390,1:00:04.910
...the ideas discussed in this video

1:00:04.910,1:00:07.080
...are not part of one linear argument.

1:00:07.080,1:00:08.630
Each chapter has its own purpose,

1:00:08.630,1:00:11.000
...and it wouldn’t be possible to conclude them all here.

1:00:11.000,1:00:12.790
Instead, I’ll offer a final thought.

1:00:13.020,1:00:15.660
Mao’s disastrous and misguided policies on music

1:00:15.660,1:00:17.410
...were not based on musical ideas.

1:00:17.410,1:00:19.160
They were literal, social ideas,

1:00:19.160,1:00:21.500
...about things like class and self-sufficiency,

1:00:21.500,1:00:23.630
...applied to a non-literal art form.

1:00:23.630,1:00:24.500
And by doing this,

1:00:24.500,1:00:27.650
...by applying a logical framework
filled with rigid associations

1:00:27.650,1:00:29.760
...to determine the country’s musical direction,

1:00:29.760,1:00:31.900
...Mao was treating his people like a jigsaw puzzle,

1:00:31.900,1:00:34.450
...as if they could be moved around until they made sense.

1:00:34.450,1:00:36.060
He didn’t think about what music meant to them

1:00:36.060,1:00:37.950
...or whether their experiences fell outside

1:00:37.950,1:00:40.300
...the shockingly basic framework he had devised.

1:00:40.300,1:00:42.440
This is profoundly unempathetic.

1:00:42.860,1:00:45.480
He was living in the dumb, literal world of his own head

1:00:45.480,1:00:47.400
...and ignoring anything that didn’t fit in it.

1:00:47.640,1:00:49.900
And this is a mistake we can learn lessons from.

1:00:49.900,1:00:52.540
When we encounter musical ideas we think are misguided,

1:00:52.540,1:00:55.598
...we tend to fall back on literal, logical explanations

1:00:55.600,1:00:56.820
...for why people hold them.

1:00:56.820,1:00:59.690
Explanations that often take
the shape of a mental pathology.

1:00:59.690,1:01:01.980
A theory about what must be wrong with their minds

1:01:01.980,1:01:03.980
...that they’d arrive at such a flawed conclusion.

1:01:03.980,1:01:05.200
They have basic tastes.

1:01:05.200,1:01:06.330
They’re uneducated.

1:01:06.330,1:01:07.550
They’re living in the past.

1:01:07.550,1:01:08.900
They’re latching onto a trend.

1:01:08.900,1:01:09.920
They’re pretentious.

1:01:09.920,1:01:12.190
They like complexity for complexity’s sake.

1:01:12.190,1:01:13.100
They’re deluded.

1:01:13.100,1:01:13.920
They’re confused.

1:01:13.920,1:01:14.980
They’re looking for attention.

1:01:14.980,1:01:16.290
They think they’re superior.

1:01:16.290,1:01:17.038
And so on.

1:01:17.040,1:01:18.760
In the absence of an explanation,

1:01:18.760,1:01:21.260
...we fill the gaps with a story that makes sense.

1:01:21.260,1:01:23.630
Music will always present a tempting battleground

1:01:23.630,1:01:25.580
...for us to hash out our social differences,

1:01:25.580,1:01:28.020
...because it’s such an emotional and personal medium,

1:01:28.020,1:01:30.680
...one where intentions can easily be misconstrued

1:01:30.680,1:01:32.480
...or deliberately misrepresented.

1:01:32.480,1:01:34.390
Instead, what we need to do is get better at

1:01:34.390,1:01:37.260
...putting ourselves in the position
of people we don’t understand,

1:01:37.260,1:01:39.838
...and when encountering a
preference we think is preposterous,

1:01:39.840,1:01:40.730
...take the hard road

1:01:40.730,1:01:43.950
...and assume that there must be some
legitimate reason for it existing,

1:01:43.950,1:01:46.590
...one we may not be able to ever completely explain.

1:01:46.930,1:01:48.970
And the only instance where this isn’t true

1:01:48.970,1:01:51.118
...is my dismissal of André Rieu’s music,

1:01:51.120,1:01:52.570
...which is objectively terrible,

1:01:52.570,1:01:53.920
...and I know what I’m talking about

1:01:54.580,1:01:55.160
...because

1:01:55.950,1:01:56.890
...I’m brilliant.

0:00:03.120,0:00:05.280
Sibelius is truly revolutionary,

0:00:05.280,0:00:06.240
...in the sense that,

0:00:06.240,0:00:08.240
...no matter how carefully you try to work with it,

0:00:08.480,0:00:11.080
...it always seems to be trying to rise up against you.

0:00:11.380,0:00:12.340
It's hard to learn,

0:00:12.340,0:00:13.240
...poorly maintained,

0:00:13.240,0:00:15.700
...and sports a navigation system
that seems to take pride in

0:00:15.700,0:00:17.700
...putting things where you'd least expect them.

0:00:17.720,0:00:20.060
And that's going to be our design focus for this video:

0:00:20.060,0:00:23.340
The subtleties of designing a
navigation for a complex program.

0:00:23.340,0:00:24.260
And, disclaimer:

0:00:24.260,0:00:26.740
Although this will initially start
like a pretty down-to-earth,

0:00:26.740,0:00:28.260
...reasonable design analysis,

0:00:28.260,0:00:30.640
...like my last video about Propellerhead's Reason,

0:00:30.640,0:00:32.700
Sibelius has a particularly unique ability

0:00:32.700,0:00:34.580
...to drive me actually insane.

0:00:34.760,0:00:36.620
So I'll keep it together as long as I can,

0:00:36.620,0:00:39.400
...but don't be surprised if I go
slightly off the rails at some point.

0:00:39.720,0:00:40.700
You have been warned.

0:00:40.860,0:00:42.660
So, in case you're new to this channel,

0:00:42.660,0:00:44.900
...I'm a composer and also a software designer,

0:00:44.900,0:00:47.640
...which is why I find Sibelius particularly frustrating,

0:00:47.640,0:00:49.900
...since it's got some genius functionality in there

0:00:49.900,0:00:51.800
...that I make use of on a daily basis,

0:00:51.800,0:00:53.360
...but which is obstructed from flourishing

0:00:53.360,0:00:55.480
...by its bafflingly haphazard design.

0:00:55.640,0:00:56.620
So what's wrong with it?

0:00:57.140,0:00:57.940
[shudders]

0:00:58.360,0:00:59.660
And how did it get this way?

0:01:00.580,0:01:02.800
So, Sibelius was created by twin brothers

0:01:02.800,0:01:04.180
...Ben and Jonathan Finn.

0:01:04.180,0:01:06.580
That's them there outside King's College at Cambridge,

0:01:06.580,0:01:07.400
...where they grew up.

0:01:07.680,0:01:08.840
At the age of 17,

0:01:08.840,0:01:12.020
...they began working on a software
engraving tool as a side project,

0:01:12.020,0:01:13.980
...which, after a few years of refining,

0:01:13.980,0:01:16.660
...with encouragement from the
composer Peter Maxwell Davies,

0:01:16.660,0:01:18.620
...they decided to publish under the company name

0:01:18.620,0:01:20.020
'Sibelius Software'.

0:01:20.020,0:01:21.840
The homage to the famous Finnish composer

0:01:21.840,0:01:22.860
Jean Sibelius

0:01:22.860,0:01:25.260
...was chosen as a, sort of, oblique play on words.

0:01:25.600,0:01:26.100
Hmm...

0:01:26.100,0:01:26.880
I mean, why not?

0:01:27.320,0:01:27.880
When released,

0:01:27.880,0:01:29.440
...it began to spread through word of mouth

0:01:29.440,0:01:31.140
...to composers throughout Britain,

0:01:31.140,0:01:34.180
...many of whom were trying out 
this type of software for the first time.

0:01:34.180,0:01:37.380
It was originally created to work on the Acorn Computer

0:01:37.380,0:01:39.800
...which had become popular in the educational space,

0:01:39.800,0:01:41.820
...something that would become
a competitive advantage

0:01:41.820,0:01:43.240
...for Sibelius later on.

0:01:43.240,0:01:44.800
Its rivals at the time included:

0:01:45.440,0:01:46.240
...where you had to type

0:01:46.240,0:01:49.080
...rows of pitches and time values
into a DOS-like interface

0:01:49.080,0:01:50.800
...in order to see a visual result,

0:01:50.800,0:01:52.360
...which is massively time-consuming,

0:01:52.540,0:01:54.020
...and another program, Finale,

0:01:54.020,0:01:55.600
...which is still being used today,

0:01:55.600,0:01:56.560
...but which isn't very good.

0:01:56.560,0:01:56.650
ᶠᵒʳᵉˢʰᵃᵈᵒʷⁱⁿᵍ?
...but which isn't very good.

0:01:57.000,0:01:58.060
And so Sibelius,

0:01:58.060,0:01:59.800
...due to being comparatively easy to use

0:01:59.800,0:02:01.460
...and filled with superior features,

0:02:01.460,0:02:03.360
...became the dominant notation software.

0:02:03.440,0:02:04.800
Quite an accomplishment for a pair of

0:02:04.800,0:02:06.340
...obscure first-time developers.

0:02:06.640,0:02:07.860
However, over time,

0:02:07.860,0:02:09.760
...the application became more complicated.

0:02:09.940,0:02:11.740
And as features began to multiply,

0:02:11.740,0:02:13.360
...the existing navigation expanded,

0:02:13.360,0:02:16.380
...and the sheer number of buttons
and menus became overwhelming.

0:02:16.780,0:02:18.320
As the long-time Sibelius employee

0:02:18.320,0:02:19.820
...Daniel Spreadbury observed:

0:02:30.200,0:02:31.820
So to try and solve this problem,

0:02:31.820,0:02:33.620
...Sibelius looked to another creation app

0:02:33.620,0:02:35.820
...which had faced a similar build-up of functionality:

0:02:35.980,0:02:37.040
Microsoft Word.

0:02:37.200,0:02:39.000
Here's a clip of the designer Jensen Harris,

0:02:39.000,0:02:40.460
...who worked on Word for years,

0:02:40.460,0:02:42.880
...describing the problems they faced while designing it:

0:02:50.820,0:02:52.640
"...and one word we found"

0:02:52.640,0:02:54.540
"...started being talked about with Office"

0:02:54.540,0:02:56.620
"...every time the press wrote a story about Office."

0:02:56.960,0:02:57.820
"And that word"

0:02:58.120,0:02:59.120
"...was 'bloat'."

0:02:59.300,0:03:01.180
He then goes on to describe how they began

0:03:01.180,0:03:03.320
...trying to reduce complexity on the screen:

0:03:03.320,0:03:05.340
"And so, the first of the features that we did"

0:03:05.340,0:03:07.400
"...to reduce the perception of bloat"

0:03:07.440,0:03:09.440
"...was something called 'IntelliMenus.'"

0:03:09.720,0:03:12.920
"Instead of actually reducing
the complexity of the product..."

0:03:13.420,0:03:15.460
"...well, we could hide some of it from you."

0:03:15.640,0:03:17.280
"So what we do is, we'll take"

0:03:17.280,0:03:19.420
"...a random set of menu items,"

0:03:19.440,0:03:20.620
"...and we would"

0:03:20.620,0:03:21.220
"...hide them."

0:03:22.500,0:03:24.920
Which turned out to be a bit of
 a self-fulfilling prophecy,

0:03:24.920,0:03:26.520
...since people don't tend to click on options

0:03:26.520,0:03:28.120
...they can't see right in front of them.

0:03:28.460,0:03:30.140
So, we'll come back to this in a minute.

0:03:30.420,0:03:32.240
Let's get back to Sibelius Software,

0:03:32.240,0:03:33.640
...who, to complicate matters

0:03:33.640,0:03:35.560
...during the development of Sibelius 6,

0:03:35.560,0:03:37.700
...sold it to the American multimedia company:

0:03:38.620,0:03:40.380
AVID are a very mixed bag.

0:03:40.380,0:03:42.260
On the one hand, you have their flagship app

0:03:42.260,0:03:43.420
Media Composer,

0:03:43.420,0:03:44.540
...which is an unpleasant

0:03:44.540,0:03:46.760
...power-hungry beast of an editing application

0:03:46.780,0:03:48.580
...that only runs on high-end machines,

0:03:48.580,0:03:50.760
...that is, if you can figure out how its controls work.

0:03:50.760,0:03:52.580
And on the other hand, you have Pro Tools,

0:03:52.580,0:03:54.720
...a solid, easy-to-use audio workstation

0:03:54.720,0:03:56.740
...that AVID bought in 1993.

0:03:56.740,0:03:58.620
And so, under this new ownership,

0:03:58.620,0:04:00.360
...Sibelius 6 gave way to

0:04:00.360,0:04:01.820
...Sibelius 7,

0:04:01.820,0:04:02.380
...where...

0:04:03.020,0:04:03.640
[sigh]

0:04:04.180,0:04:05.600
Okay, before I go any further

0:04:05.600,0:04:07.780
...discussing the design of Sibelius 7,

0:04:07.780,0:04:09.960
...it's tempting to lay the blame for the bad parts

0:04:09.960,0:04:11.460
...solidly at AVID's door.

0:04:11.460,0:04:14.440
But we think need to be careful not to
buy into that narrative too much,

0:04:14.440,0:04:16.060
...since the Sibelius design team

0:04:16.060,0:04:18.060
...were largely in place when 7 came out,

0:04:18.060,0:04:21.160
...and some of its oldest designers
were pretty vocal in defending it.

0:04:21.520,0:04:22.700
So what did they do?

0:04:22.980,0:04:25.180
Well, let's again return to Jensen Harris

0:04:25.180,0:04:28.060
...to hear how they tackled this
problem with Microsoft Word,

0:04:28.060,0:04:30.440
...which was to create a new design pattern called

0:04:30.440,0:04:31.100
'The Ribbon',

0:04:31.100,0:04:32.760
...which I'm sure you're all familiar with.

0:04:33.080,0:04:35.980
The idea of the ribbon is not just
to make stuff easier to find,

0:04:35.980,0:04:37.460
...but also to give a good indication of

0:04:37.460,0:04:40.480
...what the feature in question will
actually do before you click on it.

0:04:40.760,0:04:42.280
"We also have something throughout the UI"

0:04:42.280,0:04:43.880
"...which is called 'Live Preview,' "

0:04:43.880,0:04:45.900
"...which says at any time you hover over"

0:04:46.160,0:04:47.500
"...er, a formatting choice,"

0:04:47.900,0:04:49.600
"...we'll show you exactly what it looks like."

0:04:49.920,0:04:51.840
"So what I'm going to do is use the position gallery,"

0:04:52.080,0:04:54.040
"...which, again, just shows you
the most common places"

0:04:54.040,0:04:56.200
"...that people want to put pictures"

0:04:56.200,0:04:56.700
"...in-"

0:04:56.700,0:04:58.320
"...in, er, their documents."

0:04:58.320,0:04:59.680
"I'll split the text into columns."

0:04:59.680,0:05:00.840
"I'll just choose columns,"

0:05:01.060,0:05:01.780
"...eh, two..."

0:05:01.780,0:05:03.940
And to go a little bit beyond this presentation,

0:05:03.940,0:05:05.180
...let's have a look at the improvements

0:05:05.180,0:05:07.200
...that led us to where the ribbon is today.

0:05:07.480,0:05:08.540
This is Word Online,

0:05:08.540,0:05:10.380
...where the visuals have been further de-cluttered,

0:05:10.380,0:05:12.600
...and where options still give a clear visual indication

0:05:12.600,0:05:14.360
...of what's going to happen when you click on them.

0:05:14.660,0:05:15.440
Not to mention,

0:05:15.440,0:05:16.620
...they now have a search function,

0:05:16.620,0:05:18.360
...which can be a nice way of asking the program

0:05:18.360,0:05:20.280
...to initiate a command like spell-checking,

0:05:20.280,0:05:22.200
...without needing to find the button in question.

0:05:22.440,0:05:24.500
Notice also that the labels are pretty clear.

0:05:24.640,0:05:25.240
'Insert'

0:05:25.240,0:05:26.680
That's where you insert things.

0:05:26.680,0:05:27.360
'Layout'

0:05:27.360,0:05:28.380
That's where you see options

0:05:28.380,0:05:30.340
...for margins and spacing and stuff.

0:05:30.340,0:05:32.140
This is what the ribbon is meant to be.

0:05:32.140,0:05:33.580
Clear and easy to use.

0:05:34.060,0:05:35.580
Now, when Sibelius licensed

0:05:35.580,0:05:37.260
...the ribbon pattern from Microsoft,

0:05:37.260,0:05:39.100
...they got a lot of criticism from it,

0:05:39.100,0:05:42.180
...with the general attitude being that
it was the wrong system to use.

0:05:42.460,0:05:43.400
My own feeling is that

0:05:43.400,0:05:45.260
...the ribbon was a perfectly fine choice,

0:05:45.260,0:05:47.460
...but that Sibelius made really terrible use of it.

0:05:47.860,0:05:49.580
And by not designing the ribbon well,

0:05:49.580,0:05:52.140
...it's had a knock-on effect on
other parts of the app too.

0:05:52.380,0:05:53.700
The best way to illustrate all of this

0:05:53.700,0:05:54.960
...is to see it in context.

0:05:55.160,0:05:57.400
So, let's imagine ourselves to be a first-time user

0:05:57.400,0:05:59.240
...trying to achieve something really basic.

0:05:59.540,0:06:00.920
I'm using version 8 by the way,

0:06:00.920,0:06:03.180
...but the navigation is nearly identical to 7.

0:06:03.400,0:06:04.120
Okay.

0:06:04.480,0:06:06.020
Are you ready for the pain?

0:06:06.700,0:06:08.340
So after you've loaded up the app,

0:06:08.340,0:06:10.280
...you're presented with a bunch of presets,

0:06:10.280,0:06:13.160
...and right off the bat, there's a
slightly absurd visual contradiction:

0:06:13.160,0:06:14.500
A category titled:

0:06:15.680,0:06:18.220
This contains the only option
anyone actually cares about:

0:06:18.220,0:06:19.280
Blank page.

0:06:19.280,0:06:20.000
Or, if not,

0:06:20.000,0:06:22.160
...you can scroll through the other 66 presets

0:06:22.160,0:06:23.220
...to find what you want.

0:06:23.220,0:06:24.640
By the way, I notice solo piano

0:06:24.640,0:06:25.880
...is the very last option.

0:06:26.100,0:06:26.640
Really?

0:06:26.900,0:06:28.560
Solo piano gets bottom billing?

0:06:28.800,0:06:29.300
Below:

0:06:29.960,0:06:30.460
...and:

0:06:31.480,0:06:32.040
Well,

0:06:32.040,0:06:32.620
...okay.

0:06:32.840,0:06:34.760
And then, in the spot where most apps have a

0:06:34.760,0:06:36.600
...'Create' or 'Confirm' button,

0:06:36.600,0:06:38.320
They've opted comically for

0:06:38.320,0:06:39.420
'Quit Sibelius'.

0:06:39.560,0:06:40.640
I just love this.

0:06:40.640,0:06:41.620
It's as if they're saying,

0:06:41.620,0:06:43.780
ʏᴏᴜ'ᴠᴇ ᴀʟʀᴇᴀᴅʏ ꜱᴇᴇɴ ᴛʜᴇ 'ɴᴏ ᴄᴀᴛᴇɢᴏʀʏ' ᴛʜɪɴɢ.

0:06:43.780,0:06:44.680
ᴛʀᴜꜱᴛ ᴜꜱ.

0:06:44.680,0:06:46.780
ɪᴛ ᴏɴʟʏ ɢᴏᴇs ᴅᴏᴡɴʜɪʟʟ ꜰʀᴏᴍ ʜᴇʀᴇ.

0:06:46.780,0:06:48.880
So anyway, you click on 'Blank' page,

0:06:48.880,0:06:49.900
...ignore the presets,

0:06:49.900,0:06:51.460
(Oh, I mean, that's what everyone does, right?)

0:06:51.460,0:06:53.800
(I mean, if there's anyone out there
who actually bothers with the screen,)

0:06:53.800,0:06:54.980
(c- could you let me know?)

0:06:55.180,0:06:55.680
...and,

0:06:55.680,0:06:56.760
...so then you go down-

0:06:56.760,0:06:57.360
Oh oops!

0:06:57.360,0:06:58.380
Almost got me!

0:06:58.380,0:06:59.040
Okay.

0:06:59.040,0:07:00.900
Let's just do a little design pass on this.

0:07:01.140,0:07:01.820
Uh... Yep.

0:07:01.820,0:07:02.320
Whoop!

0:07:02.320,0:07:02.960
There you go.

0:07:03.400,0:07:04.400
These exist already,

0:07:04.400,0:07:05.320
...let's get rid of those.

0:07:05.320,0:07:05.820
Uh...

0:07:05.820,0:07:06.740
Yeah, that'll do fine.

0:07:07.060,0:07:07.560
Okay.

0:07:07.560,0:07:08.980
Now we're brought to the Home tab.

0:07:09.180,0:07:10.700
So, with the ribbon design,

0:07:10.700,0:07:12.040
...'Home' is meant to be where you find

0:07:12.040,0:07:14.200
...the core actions people use all the time,

0:07:14.200,0:07:16.360
...you know, to avoid having to click around too much.

0:07:16.640,0:07:17.360
In Word,

0:07:17.360,0:07:18.460
...that'll be things like

0:07:18.460,0:07:19.120
...font,

0:07:19.120,0:07:19.740
...size,

0:07:19.740,0:07:20.440
...styling,

0:07:20.440,0:07:21.080
...et cetera.

0:07:21.080,0:07:23.220
In Sibelius, I think there are only about

0:07:23.220,0:07:25.640
...four functionalities here I'd consider primary,

0:07:25.640,0:07:27.520
...along with the smattering of random stuff

0:07:27.520,0:07:28.960
...that will be better suited elsewhere.

0:07:28.960,0:07:30.360
You'll see what I mean in a second.

0:07:30.360,0:07:31.540
So, if we want to make music,

0:07:31.540,0:07:32.900
...we need some instruments, right?

0:07:32.900,0:07:34.860
Well, thankfully, that, at least,

0:07:34.860,0:07:36.820
...is here in the Home tab where it should be,

0:07:36.820,0:07:38.320
...although I always have to double-check

0:07:38.320,0:07:39.400
...to make sure it's the right button,

0:07:39.400,0:07:41.080
...because the trumpet keeps throwing me,

0:07:41.080,0:07:42.500
...and the incomplete title

0:07:42.500,0:07:43.480
...'Add or Remove'

0:07:43.480,0:07:45.080
...requires a pause to understand.

0:07:45.300,0:07:46.420
Add or remove what?

0:07:46.420,0:07:48.920
Oh, I guess it says 'Instruments' down there to the right,

0:07:48.920,0:07:50.740
...but that's not really how eyes work.

0:07:50.740,0:07:52.440
Okay, considering that this might be

0:07:52.440,0:07:53.920
...the most important button in the app,

0:07:53.920,0:07:56.000
...let's call it 'Add or Remove Instruments'.

0:07:56.260,0:07:57.560
I think it deserves the space,

0:07:57.560,0:07:59.460
...you know, you've got a button over here called

0:08:01.100,0:08:04.000
And, because it looks a little bit like
an 'Add or Remove Trumpet' button,

0:08:04.000,0:08:06.700
...let's make it generic by changing the icon to a plus,

0:08:06.700,0:08:07.860
...like everyone else does.

0:08:08.120,0:08:10.540
Okay, so let's choose to add an instrument.

0:08:10.540,0:08:12.560
And now, we're faced with this eyesore.

0:08:12.560,0:08:14.440
This is the real heart of Sibelius.

0:08:14.440,0:08:16.440
Endless horrible dialog boxes.

0:08:16.700,0:08:18.660
And even though this is one of the better ones,

0:08:18.660,0:08:20.920
...the sloppy attention to detail is everywhere.

0:08:21.280,0:08:22.320
So the idea is:

0:08:22.320,0:08:23.640
You choose instruments from here (left)

0:08:23.640,0:08:24.820
...and put them here (right)

0:08:24.820,0:08:26.000
...to add them to your score.

0:08:26.220,0:08:27.820
And because the list is so big,

0:08:28.040,0:08:30.440
...they gave us a search bar
to make it easier to find stuff.

0:08:30.660,0:08:31.520
That's useful.

0:08:31.520,0:08:32.700
So let's find a cello.

0:08:33.040,0:08:33.880
Uh...

0:08:33.880,0:08:34.440
Really?

0:08:34.440,0:08:35.760
You can't locate 'cello'?

0:08:35.960,0:08:38.200
Oh, I guess I need to remember the full name

0:08:38.200,0:08:40.000
...'violoncello' that no one uses.

0:08:40.160,0:08:41.000
Okay. Well...

0:08:41.000,0:08:42.080
Let's add a guitar.

0:08:42.420,0:08:43.520
Ugh, that's helpful.

0:08:43.520,0:08:45.060
We have all this space available to us,

0:08:45.060,0:08:46.720
...but the drop-down is teeny,

0:08:46.720,0:08:48.500
...so we can't see what the options are.

0:08:48.500,0:08:50.860
You're on version 8 and you haven't fixed this yet!?

0:08:50.860,0:08:52.320
But even if it had been big enough,

0:08:52.320,0:08:54.740
...you still wouldn't been able to find a useful result,

0:08:54.740,0:08:56.440
...because putting in 'guitar' isn't enough

0:08:56.440,0:08:58.400
...to get the two most common types.

0:08:58.400,0:08:59.620
You need to actually type

0:08:59.620,0:09:01.540
...'acoustic' or 'electric' first,

0:09:01.540,0:09:03.480
...because this is search from the early '90s.

0:09:03.840,0:09:05.940
Can I have that 'Quit Sibelius' button back please?

0:09:05.940,0:09:06.320
[pop]

0:09:06.320,0:09:07.440
Oh, thank you!

0:09:08.000,0:09:09.700
So let's add a piano to the score.

0:09:09.920,0:09:12.140
Now, understanding what each of the element does

0:09:12.140,0:09:14.140
...is a little bit of a trial-and-error affair.

0:09:14.440,0:09:15.200
For example,

0:09:15.200,0:09:16.660
...the 'Add' button relates to this (left),

0:09:16.660,0:09:18.440
...but the 'Delete' button relates to this (right).

0:09:18.840,0:09:20.700
And look at the tick box all the way down here.

0:09:22.000,0:09:22.500
Okay.

0:09:22.500,0:09:24.480
You select it and get zero feedback.

0:09:24.480,0:09:25.620
And after clicking around a bit,

0:09:25.620,0:09:27.300
...you realise that it's contexual:

0:09:27.300,0:09:29.780
Either on or off for the instrument you've selected.

0:09:29.800,0:09:31.680
Okay, a little design fix for free:

0:09:31.680,0:09:33.320
Um, whe- when you click on the instrument,

0:09:33.320,0:09:34.680
...just put the tick box here.

0:09:35.060,0:09:37.020
So, let's add a stave to the piano.

0:09:38.680,0:09:39.260
Oh look.

0:09:39.260,0:09:40.540
I can't delete it now.

0:09:40.540,0:09:41.580
It's busted.

0:09:42.140,0:09:44.140
Anyway, now we have our instruments.

0:09:44.140,0:09:45.400
So a typical next step

0:09:45.400,0:09:47.080
...might be to set a tempo marking.

0:09:47.080,0:09:48.440
Tempo is pretty important,

0:09:48.440,0:09:49.760
...so it should be in 'Home', right?

0:09:50.100,0:09:50.480
Nope.

0:09:50.900,0:09:53.080
No, you need to navigate to a tab called

0:09:53.080,0:09:53.840
'Text'.

0:09:53.840,0:09:55.100
That's intuitive.

0:09:55.100,0:09:57.020
Then you need to look in the drop-down titled

0:09:57.020,0:09:57.880
'Styles'.

0:09:58.480,0:09:58.580
ᴜʜ

0:09:58.580,0:09:58.680
ᴜᴜʜ

0:09:58.680,0:09:58.780
ᴜᴜᴜʜ

0:09:58.780,0:09:58.880
ᴜᴜᴜᴜʜ

0:09:58.880,0:09:58.980
ᴜᴜᴜᴜᴜʜ

0:09:58.980,0:09:59.080
ᴜᴜᴜᴜᴜᴜʜ

0:09:59.080,0:09:59.180
ᴜᴜᴜᴜᴜᴜᴜʜ

0:09:59.180,0:09:59.280
ᴜᴜᴜᴜᴜᴜᴜᴜʜ

0:09:59.180,0:09:59.280
ᴜᴜᴜᴜᴜᴜᴜᴜʜʜ

0:09:59.280,0:09:59.380
ᴜᴜᴜᴜᴜᴜᴜᴜʜʜʜ

0:09:59.380,0:09:59.480
ᴜᴜᴜᴜᴜᴜᴜᴜʜʜʜʜ

0:09:59.480,0:09:59.580
ᴜᴜᴜᴜᴜᴜᴜᴜʜʜʜʜʜ

0:09:59.580,0:09:59.680
ᴜᴜᴜᴜᴜᴜᴜᴜʜʜʜʜʜʜ

0:09:59.860,0:10:00.880
And when you do that,

0:10:00.880,0:10:03.100
...you see there's a whole range of things in here:

0:10:03.100,0:10:04.680
Different types of markings,

0:10:04.680,0:10:05.520
...techniques,

0:10:05.520,0:10:06.460
...expressions.

0:10:06.620,0:10:07.720
Oh, I get it!

0:10:07.720,0:10:09.420
All these things are written as

0:10:09.420,0:10:09.980
...text.

0:10:10.160,0:10:12.160
That's why they're being categorized that way,

0:10:12.160,0:10:13.080
...even though

0:10:13.080,0:10:14.640
...some of them don't contain text.

0:10:14.940,0:10:17.040
Oh, and I love how there's a category called

0:10:17.040,0:10:17.860
...'Common'.

0:10:17.860,0:10:19.420
Yet, before you open it,

0:10:19.420,0:10:21.300
...they only show the first two options.

0:10:21.300,0:10:22.340
Uh... Hey guys,

0:10:22.340,0:10:24.040
...I- I'm fairly certain tempo is more common

0:10:24.040,0:10:26.140
...than the direction to pluck your strings.

0:10:26.140,0:10:28.100
But, as if that wasn't painful enough,

0:10:28.100,0:10:30.580
...what's coming up next is just pure madness,

0:10:30.580,0:10:32.300
...and any first-time user would be forgiven

0:10:32.300,0:10:34.100
...for completely losing the plot here.

0:10:34.100,0:10:35.420
So you click on 'Tempo',

0:10:35.420,0:10:38.580
...and your arrow turns a nearly
indistinguishable shade of blue,

0:10:38.580,0:10:40.200
...which, when you finally notice it,

0:10:40.200,0:10:42.160
...indicates that something's going to happen.

0:10:42.160,0:10:42.780
Okay.

0:10:42.780,0:10:44.760
So let's click with our special blue arrow.

0:10:44.960,0:10:45.560
Uh...

0:10:45.560,0:10:46.060
Right.

0:10:46.240,0:10:47.800
Okay, it wants us to enter text.

0:10:47.800,0:10:48.600
Oh, I get it.

0:10:48.600,0:10:49.380
Now we type:

0:10:50.620,0:10:51.340
...or something.

0:10:51.340,0:10:52.100
Oh, um...

0:10:52.100,0:10:52.900
It's not working,

0:10:52.900,0:10:54.780
...and our note duration is missing.

0:10:54.780,0:10:56.760
So here's what you should have done:

0:10:56.760,0:10:58.300
You need to click the drop-down,

0:10:58.300,0:10:59.300
...pick the tempo,

0:10:59.300,0:11:00.960
...click with the special blue arrow,

0:11:00.960,0:11:02.720
...see the insertion point, and then

0:11:02.720,0:11:04.620
...right-click to trigger a massive drop-down

0:11:04.620,0:11:06.320
...containing a bazillion options,

0:11:06.320,0:11:07.260
...and there we go.

0:11:07.260,0:11:08.600
The word 'Tempo'.

0:11:08.600,0:11:09.200
Right.

0:11:09.200,0:11:10.020
So we click on that,

0:11:10.020,0:11:11.140
...and finally...

0:11:11.520,0:11:13.660
Oh man, the note value still isn't there.

0:11:13.660,0:11:15.820
No. You need to now right-click again,

0:11:15.820,0:11:18.260
...open up the ludicrously large drop-down again,

0:11:18.260,0:11:19.280
...select the note value,

0:11:19.280,0:11:21.160
...and then finally type your tempo.

0:11:21.160,0:11:22.160
Oh, and by the way,

0:11:22.160,0:11:24.680
...it's really easy to accidentally
deselect this whole thing,

0:11:24.680,0:11:26.580
...so you may have to do this multiple times.

0:11:26.820,0:11:28.340
Ｗｏｒｔｈｙ ｏｆ Ｆｉｎｌａｎｄｉａ！

0:11:28.520,0:11:30.220
Okay, let's do a quick fix.

0:11:30.500,0:11:31.220
How about:

0:11:31.220,0:11:32.220
You go to Home,

0:11:32.220,0:11:34.380
...where a vital function like tempo should be,

0:11:34.380,0:11:35.440
...and when you select it,

0:11:35.440,0:11:37.080
...you get a ghost beside your cursor,

0:11:37.080,0:11:38.980
...which you can place and edit immediately.

0:11:39.180,0:11:40.320
You're welcome, Sibelius.

0:11:40.320,0:11:42.040
I've just massively improved your app.

0:11:42.260,0:11:45.360
But this type of fix doesn't repair
the larger structural issues,

0:11:45.360,0:11:48.340
...which is the extreme messiness and inconsistency.

0:11:48.340,0:11:49.040
For example,

0:11:49.040,0:11:50.260
...there's a category called

0:11:50.260,0:11:51.440
'Note Input',

0:11:51.440,0:11:54.340
...which, apart from one or two
specific input-type functions,

0:11:54.340,0:11:56.280
...contains options that could just as easily

0:11:56.280,0:11:58.800
...belong in the next category called 'Notations'.

0:11:59.020,0:12:00.420
This takes a long time to learn,

0:12:00.420,0:12:03.380
...especially since each one is maxed
out with unnecessary detail.

0:12:03.680,0:12:06.180
So. for those who say the ribbon was a bad choice,

0:12:06.180,0:12:07.340
...I'm not really in agreement,

0:12:07.340,0:12:09.720
...because this isn't how a ribbon is meant to work.

0:12:09.720,0:12:11.700
It's just a higgledly-piggledly launchpad

0:12:11.700,0:12:13.500
...for ever more horrendous pop-ups.

0:12:13.500,0:12:14.880
I mean, look at this one.

0:12:14.880,0:12:16.700
What on earth does THIS do?

0:12:16.700,0:12:18.320
Oh, my head is beginning to hurt.

0:12:18.520,0:12:19.160
I mean,

0:12:19.160,0:12:20.760
...look at this category called 'Layout'.

0:12:20.760,0:12:22.680
It's definitely the most appropriately named,

0:12:22.680,0:12:25.840
...but which is undermined by the
next one called 'Appearance'.

0:12:25.840,0:12:27.380
'Layout' and 'Appearance'.

0:12:27.380,0:12:28.160
Hmm...

0:12:28.160,0:12:29.740
You want to edit the staff spacing?

0:12:29.740,0:12:31.740
Because it says 'Staff Spacing' there.

0:12:31.740,0:12:33.820
Then you have to have to click on this eensy little button

0:12:33.820,0:12:35.400
...to get a monster terminal called

0:12:35.400,0:12:36.820
'Engraving Rules'.

0:12:36.820,0:12:37.580
Y- Yeah-

0:12:37.580,0:12:38.080
¿¡ʇɐɥM -M

0:12:38.080,0:12:38.580
W- What!?

0:12:38.580,0:12:40.160
And then there's hundreds of disparate settings,

0:12:40.160,0:12:41.520
...with no visual cues

0:12:41.520,0:12:43.540
...to help you know what effect
anything is going to have.

0:12:43.540,0:12:44.920
It's just a parameter dump,

0:12:44.920,0:12:47.340
...perpetrated by some dev who probably assumed that

0:12:47.340,0:12:49.820
...a designer will clean it up at some point in the future.

0:12:50.140,0:12:52.300
Using it is an absolute nightmare!

0:12:52.300,0:12:52.920
Trust me.

0:12:52.920,0:12:54.720
Even Finale, with all it's problems,

0:12:54.720,0:12:55.840
(and it's got many)

0:12:55.840,0:12:57.080
...does a better job at this,

0:12:57.080,0:12:59.540
...at least giving you SOME indication
of what's going to happen.

0:12:59.540,0:13:01.380
But even if they included this information,

0:13:01.380,0:13:03.260
...you'll still find that the thing you want

0:13:03.260,0:13:04.940
...is in some other dialog box.

0:13:04.940,0:13:07.540
I mean, let's just move over to the Appearance tab

0:13:07.540,0:13:10.680
...and click the 𝘦𝘦𝘯𝘴𝘺 'Design and Position' button and...

0:13:10.680,0:13:11.460
Oh no!

0:13:11.460,0:13:13.700
Another endless list of crazy options!

0:13:13.980,0:13:15.360
What about Instrument names?

0:13:15.560,0:13:16.320
Oh no!

0:13:16.320,0:13:18.920
We're back to that Engraving rules dialog box again,

0:13:18.920,0:13:21.200
...the same dialog triggered from two different menus

0:13:21.200,0:13:23.940
...that have titles which are basically
synonymous with each other!

0:13:23.940,0:13:25.600
Have you ever heard of Maurice Pratt?

0:13:25.600,0:13:27.640
Look up 'Maurice Pratt' and watch his '80s

0:13:27.640,0:13:29.700
...Star Wars commercial for Quinnsworth.

0:13:29.700,0:13:30.480
It's pretty good.

0:13:30.480,0:13:32.340
"Show me these Quinnsworth toys!"

0:13:32.340,0:13:33.860
"Okay, Darth, let's look at this together!"

0:13:33.860,0:13:35.020
"Jedi Speeder Bike?"

0:13:35.020,0:13:36.020
"£6.99!"

0:13:36.360,0:13:37.380
Here's another one:

0:13:37.380,0:13:40.920
Imagine you've just plugged in an
external sound unit into your computer,

0:13:40.920,0:13:42.820
...as many, many people do.

0:13:42.820,0:13:44.960
And like every other audio app in the world,

0:13:44.960,0:13:46.780
...you'd probably want easy access

0:13:46.780,0:13:48.920
...to allow you to switch to that device, right?

0:13:49.160,0:13:50.120
Well, okay.

0:13:50.120,0:13:51.440
I'm going to roll up this ribbon,

0:13:51.440,0:13:52.480
...and you tell me

0:13:52.480,0:13:54.200
...where you'd look to find that option.

0:13:54.480,0:13:56.780
Press 'Pause' and take all the time you need.

0:13:57.200,0:13:57.880
Okay?

0:13:57.880,0:13:58.380
You ready?

0:13:58.380,0:13:58.500
ɪ ʜᴏᴘᴇ
You ready?

0:13:58.760,0:14:00.980
Was your answer in the 'Play' category?

0:14:00.980,0:14:01.660
No?

0:14:01.660,0:14:02.840
I'm not surprised,

0:14:02.840,0:14:04.040
...but that's where it is.

0:14:04.040,0:14:04.900
Don't worry, though.

0:14:04.900,0:14:06.140
The test isn't over.

0:14:06.140,0:14:07.480
Where do you think we go now?

0:14:07.740,0:14:08.360
Hmm?

0:14:08.360,0:14:10.240
Did you say 'Configuration'?

0:14:10.240,0:14:11.320
Congratulations!

0:14:11.320,0:14:12.520
That's the right answer!

0:14:12.520,0:14:13.660
B- But no, you're wrong.

0:14:13.660,0:14:15.820
It's in this little eensy button down here,

0:14:15.820,0:14:17.500
...but we're not quite there, because:

0:14:17.500,0:14:19.920
First, they show you a bunch of audio sampler settings,

0:14:19.920,0:14:21.040
...and then you need to figure out

0:14:21.040,0:14:23.380
...to look in the last place anyone ever would:

0:14:23.380,0:14:24.520
Right at the bottom left,

0:14:24.520,0:14:25.880
...where we could finally see:

0:14:27.600,0:14:28.460
There we go!

0:14:28.600,0:14:29.100
𝑅𝑜𝓁𝓁𝒾𝓃'

0:14:29.280,0:14:29.780
𝑅𝑜𝓁𝓁𝒾𝓃'

0:14:29.940,0:14:30.480
𝑅𝑜𝓁𝓁𝒾𝓃'

0:14:31.260,0:14:33.800
Why can't they do a pass at how things are structured,

0:14:33.800,0:14:35.080
...starting with the tab names?

0:14:35.240,0:14:35.740
I mean,

0:14:35.740,0:14:37.920
...if you look at another program called 'Dorico',

0:14:37.920,0:14:39.520
...you can see how easy it can be.

0:14:39.520,0:14:41.200
They have one category called 'Write',

0:14:41.200,0:14:42.560
...that contains all the things you need

0:14:42.560,0:14:44.680
...to actually write the notes in your score,

0:14:44.680,0:14:46.500
...and another one called 'Engrave',

0:14:46.500,0:14:49.240
...which allows you to edit the appearance
of everything you've written.

0:14:49.240,0:14:51.240
And look at how Engraving rules work!

0:14:51.240,0:14:53.040
They appear under the actual score,

0:14:53.040,0:14:55.300
...so you can see the result of the changes you've made.

0:14:55.300,0:14:57.760
Why do dialog boxes when you can do this?

0:14:57.960,0:14:58.620
Oh man,

0:14:58.620,0:15:00.900
...I guess I just mentioned Dorico, didn't I?

0:15:00.900,0:15:01.400
Well,

0:15:01.400,0:15:02.920
...I guess I'm gonna have to talk about

0:15:02.920,0:15:04.160
...'The Event' then.

0:15:04.160,0:15:05.160
Okay, real quick:

0:15:05.160,0:15:06.680
After AVID bought Sibelius,

0:15:06.680,0:15:08.540
...they went through a corporate restructuring,

0:15:08.540,0:15:11.120
...selling off assets and laying
off some of their employees.

0:15:11.120,0:15:12.040
And as part of this,

0:15:12.040,0:15:13.860
...they decided, quite bafflingly,

0:15:13.860,0:15:15.300
...to stop supporting Sibelius,

0:15:15.300,0:15:17.280
...while firing the entire London team.

0:15:17.280,0:15:20.040
Here's a picture of the Sibelius office in Finsbury Park,

0:15:20.040,0:15:21.340
...taken by an employee

0:15:21.340,0:15:22.920
...before they closed the doors for good.

0:15:23.160,0:15:26.020
So, because Sibelius is a widely used application,

0:15:26.020,0:15:28.900
...there was a very large and
widely covered public outcry.

0:15:28.900,0:15:31.620
Ben and Jonathan Finn stepped
in to try and buy it back again,

0:15:31.620,0:15:32.640
...but were rebuffed.

0:15:32.640,0:15:34.340
And in 2014,

0:15:34.340,0:15:36.280
...as AVID's share performance was tumbling,

0:15:36.280,0:15:37.380
...they altered course,

0:15:37.380,0:15:40.520
...announcing that they were actually
going to support Sibelius after all.

0:15:40.520,0:15:41.140
Only,

0:15:41.140,0:15:42.980
...now they had to build a new team from scratch,

0:15:42.980,0:15:43.480
...because:

0:15:44.280,0:15:45.060
...who makes the excellent:

0:15:45.700,0:15:48.520
...had already rehired most of the original Sibelius team,

0:15:48.520,0:15:51.020
...putting them to work on a direct competitor called

0:15:51.020,0:15:51.780
'Dorico'.

0:15:52.080,0:15:55.080
So, when I make comparisons
between Sibelius and Dorico,

0:15:55.080,0:15:57.840
...to a certain extent I'm comparing what Sibelius is

0:15:57.840,0:15:59.440
...to what Sibelius could have been.

0:15:59.440,0:15:59.940
But,

0:15:59.940,0:16:02.600
...it's not like the current Sibelius
team can't make changes!

0:16:02.600,0:16:04.860
AVID may not be responsible for Sibelius 7,

0:16:04.860,0:16:06.280
...but you can bet that they're responsible

0:16:06.280,0:16:08.420
...for not improving it at all ever since.

0:16:08.420,0:16:08.920
I mean,

0:16:08.920,0:16:10.660
...they've made it compatible with tablet.

0:16:10.880,0:16:11.580
Great.

0:16:11.580,0:16:13.060
Now it can annoy me on tablet.

0:16:13.060,0:16:14.360
And they've added a timeline

0:16:14.360,0:16:16.280
...so we can see the same information twice.

0:16:16.280,0:16:17.020
Amazing.

0:16:17.020,0:16:19.760
An extra window I need to close
before beginning a new project.

0:16:19.760,0:16:21.000
Fix the bugs!

0:16:21.000,0:16:22.300
Stop it crashing all the time!

0:16:22.300,0:16:23.280
FIX THE BUGS!

0:16:23.440,0:16:25.080
Make it easier to find things!

0:16:25.280,0:16:26.000
By the way,

0:16:26.000,0:16:28.700
...if you look down to where the
'Quit Sibelius' button is on this page,

0:16:28.700,0:16:30.340
...you'll see a 'Like' button beside it.

0:16:30.340,0:16:31.160
Press that.

0:16:31.160,0:16:31.450
Oh.

0:16:31.450,0:16:32.480
And press that too.

0:16:32.480,0:16:33.100
Oh yeah.

0:16:33.100,0:16:33.620
ＧＯＤ

0:16:33.620,0:16:35.440
I forgot to mention the search system.

0:16:35.440,0:16:37.140
It's called 'Find in ribbon'.

0:16:37.140,0:16:39.380
Remember earlier I said that in Word Online

0:16:39.380,0:16:41.560
...if you search for something like word count,

0:16:41.560,0:16:43.920
...it's useful because you can just do it right there?

0:16:43.920,0:16:44.640
Well,

0:16:44.640,0:16:46.000
...guess what Sibelius does.

0:16:46.000,0:16:47.840
You enter what you're looking for, like...

0:16:47.840,0:16:49.420
I want to create a page break.

0:16:49.420,0:16:51.180
And rather than act as a shortcut,

0:16:51.180,0:16:53.240
...it instead drags you over to the place on the ribbon

0:16:53.240,0:16:54.460
...where that button can be found,

0:16:54.460,0:16:55.840
...and highlights it for you.

0:16:55.840,0:16:57.000
Thanks a lot!

0:16:57.000,0:16:59.660
It's like the app is annoyed at
you for not understanding it,

0:16:59.660,0:17:01.480
...like a passive-aggressive child.

0:17:01.480,0:17:02.800
"It's over here, 𝘪𝘥𝘪𝘰𝘵!"

0:17:02.800,0:17:04.320
The black beams can stretch.

0:17:04.320,0:17:05.640
They can stretch really high.

0:17:05.640,0:17:07.820
So Sibelius has lots of plug-ins,

0:17:07.820,0:17:09.300
...which are essentially bug fixes

0:17:09.300,0:17:12.460
...by people sick of waiting for AVID
to make proper improvements.

0:17:12.460,0:17:13.460
But for some reason,

0:17:13.460,0:17:15.680
...each category has its own plug-in button,

0:17:15.680,0:17:18.620
...so you have to keep opening
each individual plug-in folder

0:17:18.620,0:17:20.360
...to find whatever it is you want.

0:17:20.360,0:17:21.760
This is a solved problem!

0:17:21.760,0:17:24.240
Can we just have one place for plug-ins, please?

0:17:24.240,0:17:25.260
Why would you do this?

0:17:25.260,0:17:27.160
You ever mix up Elizabeth Olsen

0:17:27.160,0:17:27.920
...with the, uh...

0:17:27.920,0:17:28.900
...the Olsen twins?

0:17:28.900,0:17:30.260
For a while, I thought she was, like,

0:17:30.260,0:17:31.360
...the breakaway twin,

0:17:31.360,0:17:33.760
...even though I knew their names
were Mary-Kate and Ashley,

0:17:33.760,0:17:35.160
...and her name is Elizabeth.

0:17:35.360,0:17:36.820
Hold on, what does Wikipedia say?

0:17:37.060,0:17:37.880
Oh right, she's, uh-

0:17:37.880,0:17:39.020
Oh, she's their younger sister.

0:17:39.020,0:17:39.660
Oh, that makes sense.

0:17:39.660,0:17:41.160
They have this horrible drop-down

0:17:41.160,0:17:42.600
...with a million icons in it,

0:17:42.600,0:17:44.340
...and some of them are really, really important,

0:17:44.340,0:17:44.980
...like, for example,

0:17:44.980,0:17:46.980
...I'm looking for these guitar string icons,

0:17:46.980,0:17:48.560
...and I can never find them in all of this!

0:17:48.680,0:17:50.200
What should I review next̡?

0:17:50.200,0:17:50.860

Be careful when turning the pancakes.

0:17:53.280,0:17:53.920
You drop them

0:17:53.920,0:17:55.040
...and they have to go in the bin.

0:17:55.300,0:17:56.920
Do you hear me, Lieutenant Uhara?

0:17:57.140,0:17:57.980
Pay attention,

0:17:57.980,0:17:59.460
...I want clean pancakes this time!

0:18:00.180,0:18:01.000
Oh, that's handy!

0:18:01.000,0:18:02.420
Why, when you select these buttons,

0:18:02.420,0:18:04.800
...do they look like half-filled barrels of urine?

0:18:04.800,0:18:05.900
Choose nicer colors!

0:18:06.000,0:18:08.100
The purple-urine combo isn't doing it for me.

0:18:08.100,0:18:10.360
Let's take a hairpin and stretch it to the next page.

0:18:10.720,0:18:11.380
Oh, look.

0:18:11.640,0:18:12.300

Hey, do you know the way in classical music

0:18:14.700,0:18:17.060
...you need to give part scores to each musician?

0:18:17.060,0:18:18.620
Where would any sane person

0:18:18.620,0:18:20.500

Surely not hidden away here up behind this plus icon;

0:18:25.400,0:18:26.360
The plus icon,

0:18:26.360,0:18:27.940
...universally understood to mean

0:18:27.940,0:18:29.020
'add something'.

0:18:29.020,0:18:29.780
Oh man.

0:18:29.780,0:18:30.560
They ARE here.

0:18:30.560,0:18:32.380
Why would you use this to mean 'part score'?

You use the tempo slider to quickly change the tempo,

...and then Sibelius keeps resetting it.

0:18:43.720,0:18:44.480

Look at this.

0:18:56.380,0:18:57.340
Line it up!

Why won't you just line it up!?

0:18:59.180,0:19:00.400
It's almost like the position of things

0:19:00.400,0:19:02.160

Do you know how many accessibility

If Beethoven was alive today,

0:19:14.860,0:19:17.160

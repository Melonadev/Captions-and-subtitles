NOTE Paragraph

00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.370
Before I begin,

00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:02.860
I need to warn people that

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:04.270
this is a really dark topic,

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:05.890
and the things I've uncovered were

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:07.380
difficult for me to deal with,

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:10.230
so I can only reasonably expect
them to be difficult for you too.

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:11.860
It's also worth mentioning that,

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:13.140
unless I said otherwise,

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:15.710
I'm going to be using fictional
names and usernames.

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:17.820
Okay.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:18.960
So...

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.370
For me, this whole thing

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:21.910
started just before Christmas.

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:23.830
As regular viewers know,

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:25.840
I run a few teams
who develop software

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.510
that helps people write music.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.510
And in order to make sure that
our software is working as expected,

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.260
we're always on the
lookout for music people

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:33.610
who write using our tools.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.930
So, recently,

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:35.940
a friend I work with

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.260
stumbled across a composer

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.290
I'm going to call

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:39.360
'Bobby C',

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.090
who'd been sharing music on YouTube

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:42.750
that he'd made using our software.

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.470
And as my friend looked
through Bobby C's work,

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:47.810
he discovered a
really unnerving upload

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:49.390
that had come out
just the day before,

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:50.170
titled:

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:51.610
"My final piece".

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.520
My friend also noticed
another upload

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.110
which came out at the same time.

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:56.600
It was a final goodbye

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.460
from Bobby C to all his subscribers.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.320
He thanked them for
all the kind words

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:01.790
they said about his music,

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:03.500
thanked them for subscribing to him,

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.670
and then, very
matter-of-factly, announced

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.070
that he was ending his life.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.360
And then that was it.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.800
My friend was very alarmed by this.

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.250
These two videos
weren't yet 24 hours old

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:14.500
by the time he'd found them,

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:15.970
so he acted quickly,

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.200
trying to track down
Bobby C on social media

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.180
to find a way to get
a message to him.

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:21.310
He then sent me a message

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:22.850
to let me know what was happening.

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:24.590
So, after some searching, my friend

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.210
eventually tracked down
a post onto a different alias

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.910
on a forum that was dedicated
to the subject of s---cide.

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.040
This post was only a few hours old.

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:33.150
It was titled:

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.340
"I'm ready to do it..."

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:35.400
In the post,

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.600
the user identified
himself as Bobby C,

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.440
and then described the method
he was going to use to end his life.

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:42.020
In response to this post

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.960
were a few replies
bidding him farewell

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.930
and complimenting
him on his bravery.

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.140
Now, as you can imagine,

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:48.890
this got my friend
into quite a panic.

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.690
He began frantically searching
to find out more information.

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:52.920
Eventually,

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.630
we discovered what
country he was from,

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.340
and with a little bit more work,

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.820
discovered his real name too.

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.900
We passed this information
to local authorities,

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.700
but unfortunately it was too late.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.060
We got confirmation that Bobby C,

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.650
who's actually a young teenager,

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:06.880
had ended his life in

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.480
an incredibly shocking way.

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.040
We were obviously really
distraught by this.

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.100
For us, it happened over
the matter of a few hours,

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.670
and we didn't know
how to process it.

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.120
Anyway, a little later

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.330
after we'd received
confirmation of his passing,

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.540
I went for a walk with
my kids to a local park,

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.330
and a thought began to nag me.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:23.580
"Bobby C."

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.660
"You know what?"

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:25.840
"I think I know that name."

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.080
So when I got back home,

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.420
I searched for him on
various social media channels,

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.050
and immediately he popped up.

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.750
Turns out he followed me in
quite a few different places.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.780
He'd commented on
a few of my posts,

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.700
and had been a reasonably active
member of my Discord server,

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.300
which is a place where
people largely discuss music.

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.900
He was interested in composing
more than anything else.

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.110
He'd helped other composers
with their pieces,

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.780
and showcased his music one time

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.130
on one of the listening sessions.

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.160
Like me, he was a fan of chess,

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.690
and he seemed to have a
pretty solid knowledge

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:53.910
of the standard openings.

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.880
He also took part in some of
the sillier activities too,

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:57.430
like

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:58.760
submitting fun images of

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.900
really janky-looking musical toys
he'd found in his local store.

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.600
He found it funny one time when
I referred to my kids as

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:05.550
"janklings"

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.580
because one night they
just wouldn't go to sleep.

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:09.420
Looking back over his messages,

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.370
he just seemed like a
really fun sweet kid.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:12.580
And with more digging,

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.200
we got a better glimpse
into his life.

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.980
We found out more about his
hobbies and academic achievements.

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.600
We found out about his school,

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.840
as well as the wider
community he was active in.

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.920
Seeing the impact his death
had on that community was-

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.150
was just horrible.

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:26.700
The- There's no other word for it.

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.930
Now, there was another reason
I did so much digging

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:30.770
into his activity on my Discord,

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:32.080
which is that I wanted
to see whether

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.520
he'd ever hinted at his
intentions to anyone there.

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:35.450
Turns out,

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:36.410
no.

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:37.030
Nothing.

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.690
Not once did he say anything
even remotely pessimistic.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.840
He encouraged other users
with their music

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:42.480
and

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.370
took part in all the
goofiness that goes on.

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:46.390
So, I felt, like, some relief

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:47.670
that we didn't miss anything.

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.960
He'd never said a word
about his problems to us.

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:51.670
But then I began to wonder,

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:52.270
"Why?"

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:54.220
Like, why did he tell
this other group instead?

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:55.690
And that's when I began
to take a closer look

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:57.340
at the forum I mentioned earlier,

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.430
the place where he posted
his final farewell.

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.440
Now, guidelines for media
reporting on this subject

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.080
strongly discourages
naming this site directly.

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:07.060
For this reason, I'm
gonna call the site

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:08.150
'Sorrow Solution',

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:09.830
or 'SS' for short.

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.510
KELLI: Well, I was put in touch
with someone from the AFSP,

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.670
which is the American Foundation
for S---cide Prevention.

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:15.520
Um...

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.630
This was early back in 2020,

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:18.400
and...

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:19.180
and I asked her,

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:20.550
"Did you get a chance
to look at this?"

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:21.560
And she said, "I-"

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:22.450
"I can't even look at it."

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:23.430
"It's so bad."

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.950
"I can't even look at it."

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:25.760
And- And so...

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:26.850
MARTIN (narrating): This is Kelli.

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:28.440
She got in contact
with me after reading

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.910
some objections I posted
on the SS forum.

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:32.540
Her son took his own life

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.990
after being coached
by this site in 2020.

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.950
Since then,

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:38.430
she's been campaigning in
the U.S. to have it shut down.

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.160
MARTIN: How have you
and your family coped,

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:41.890
given that you know
about this forum

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:43.970
and you know that this
forum was involved?

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:45.740
KELLI: I mean, it's

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:46.600
a nightmare.

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:48.220
It's a nightmare

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:49.590
and it's something that,

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:51.510
uh, you know, is...

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:53.840
my family doesn't want me to do,

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.320
because obviously
it's very unhealthy.

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:57.870
Um, it's...

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:00.160
You know, when you're
staring at a s---cide website

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.140
for 12 to 18 hours a day,

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:04.400
trying to get information,

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:05.660
you know, for The New York Times,

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:07.350
trying to put parts
of pieces together

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:09.000
and trying to figure out who's who,

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:11.500
what is what, what is
going on, who was involved,

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:12.180
you know?

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:14.840
And while you're trying to grieve

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.520
and- and wrap your head around,

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:17.870
you know, the loss of your...

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:20.660
child that you- you
will never see again.

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:22.290
It's... horrific.

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.410
It's- I mean, there
really are no words

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:25.340
to describe

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:26.300
what it's done.

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:28.430
MARTIN (narrating):
Kelli introduced me
to other parents

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:30.060
whose children have
also taken their lives

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:31.670
after exposure to SS,

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:33.990
and who are now also campaigning
in their own countries.

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:35.860
It was learning about
their difficulties

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:37.590
in raising awareness
about this site

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:39.110
and in getting it shut down

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:40.660
that convinced me
to become involved.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.960
We'll speak to some
of these parents later,

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.660
as well as legislators
in the U.K. and the U.S..

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:48.460
The purpose of this
video is twofold.

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:50.300
First, I want to draw
people's attention

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.880
to the criminal nature
of this specific forum

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:54.400
to warn them of its dangers.

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:55.690
I guarantee you,

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:57.430
if you've not encountered
this place before,

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:59.360
you won't believe how
bad it actually is.

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:01.750
Now, my second reason
is to do something

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:03.950
I've not really seen in
any other media coverage.

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:06.750
Since SS gets millions
of page views a month,

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:09.560
(it had 10 million views
in September 2022)

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:10.880
it has a lot of users,

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:12.780
and I want to address them directly.

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:14.560
If you're a user of this site.

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:16.870
I believe there are
overwhelmingly strong reasons

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:18.190
why you should leave it.

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:19.640
I believe you are being used

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:22.210
to contribute to a significant
level of destruction.

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:24.200
Destruction you have
not been informed about.

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:25.520
So let's get started.

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:27.900
The SS forum exclusively deals with

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:29.910
matters relating to
ending one's life.

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:32.560
At first glance, it's a little
tricky to find your bearings

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:35.140
due to all the specialized
jargon and abbreviations.

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:36.480
For example,

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:39.440
the act of bringing one's life
to an end is referred to as

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:40.470
'CTB'.

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:41.630
which stands for either

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:42.598
'cease to breathe'

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:43.640
or, more popularly,

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:44.740
'catch the bus'.

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:46.030
So, while thrawling the site,

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:48.260
you'll immediately be
confronted with posts like:

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:49.870
"Preferred method of CTB?"

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:50.400
or:

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:51.080
"Please help!"

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:52.460
Wanna CTB by

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:53.510
[name of method]

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:54.940
by [sic] worried about SI".

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:56.370
'SI' stands for

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:57.950
'survival instinct', by the way.

00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:59.750
And when diving into these posts,

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:01.160
the first thing you'll
observe is just

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:02.970
the absence of content moderation,

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:04.780
despite the site's main rule:

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:06.380
"Do not encourage,"

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:07.170
"suggest,"

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:07.900
"manipulate,"

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:08.490
"coerce,"

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:09.670
"or help users carry out"

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:11.370
"acts of any nature whatsoever,"

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:12.590
"including CTB."

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:15.640
"Only provide factual information and emotional support"

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:16.870
"to those who ask for it."

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:19.170
This rule is a complete smokescreen.

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:21.490
All you need to do is
click on almost any post

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:23.120
and you'll immediately find users

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:24.350
blatantly breaking it.

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:25.160
For example,

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:26.260
in a post titled:

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.050
"I need to CTB tomorrow",

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:28.950
the user says:

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:30.310
"Please help me with a way out."

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:32.190
"My preferred method
has a low success rate"

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:33.660
"and I can't think of anything else."

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:35.310
The first response to this

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:37.700
is advice so specific and so graphic

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:39.190
I couldn't possibly repeat it here.

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:42.730
This is a standard example of
daily conversation on this forum.

00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:44.970
The people who run this
server also actively

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:47.400
discourage advice that
tells people to seek help.

00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:49.100
For example, on one thread,

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:51.490
the poster announced that he
was about to take his own life.

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:53.280
One response to this was:

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:54.290
"If you change your mind,"

00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:55.690
"call help ASAP"

00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:57.200
However, the person who said this

00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:59.790
was then chastised by
another user who replied:

00:08:00.090 --> 00:08:01.670
"Why would you say <b>THAT</b> here?"

00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:03.480
This last comment was then liked

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:05.300
by the site administrator,
by the way.

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:07.750
Their most important
policy relates to age.

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:10.590
The site states that you must
be 18 or over to sign up.

00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:12.540
Their method of enforcing this?

00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:13.410
A tickbox

00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:16.150
that you have to check to
verify that you are actually 18.

00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:17.620
No protections of any kind.

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:20.100
There are a few more examples
of policies like this,

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:21.820
some of which I'm going
to go through later,

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:23.510
but what's important
to note now is that

00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:25.410
they're not enforced
in any meaningful way.

00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:26.760
I later learned that

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:28.670
most of them were actually
added not too long ago

00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:30.860
when the site began coming
under more scrutiny,

00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:32.660
so it's a nice covering exercise.

00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:35.610
Earlier iterations of the
site were much more blatant.

00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:37.170
And this led me to wonder:

00:08:37.170 --> 00:08:38.720
If you peel away the veneer,

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:41.500
what's the actual belief system
underpinning this site?

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:43.390
And that's when I began
to uncover a hole

00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:45.160
so deep and so toxic,

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:46.470
it just beggars belief.

00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:49.220
Let's start with the
site's real philosophy.

00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:51.850
In a prominent sticky thread
at the top of the forum page,

00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:53.450
there's a list of four philosophies

00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:55.110
that the admins describe as being

00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:56.620
"adjacent" to theirs.

00:08:56.890 --> 00:08:58.840
This is key to understanding
their mindset.

00:08:59.100 --> 00:08:59.900
There's...

00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:00.560
(drumroll...)

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:01.480
nihilism,

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:03.230
which they reductively summarize as:

00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:05.850
"A philosophy that views
all life as meaningless"

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:07.440
We'll just leave that one as is.

00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:09.180
The second philosophy is

00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:10.620
antinatalism,

00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:11.800
which they describe as:

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:14.850
"A philosophy that assigns
negative value to existence..."

00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:18.500
"(because existence) is imposed upon
the individual without their consent."

00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:20.220
Now, in recent years,

00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:23.260
this particular idea has gained
traction on various forums.

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.790
I don't want to get diverted
by the subculture too much.

00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:27.230
Whatever its origins,

00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:29.200
its main idea now amounts to a

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:31.810
serious resentment of
one's parents, because

00:09:31.810 --> 00:09:33.650
they're the ones who
put you on this planet,

00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:35.420
and they did that to
satisfy their own

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:37.140
selfish requirements
to have children.

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:38.940
Here's an example of how this idea

00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:41.090
manifests in conversations
on the forum.

00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:42.080
In one thread,

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:43.740
a user describes how
he's worried about

00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:46.080
the pain he’d cause to his
mother if he took his own life.

00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:48.120
To which another user replies:

00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:51.320
"I'm always curious how
people who want to CTB"

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:52.910
"can still love their
mother so much."

00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:53.760
"After all,"

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:56.130
"they used you as a meat
shield for their own good."

00:09:56.610 --> 00:09:58.080
The third philosophy is

00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:59.380
promortalism,

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:00.680
described as:

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:03.370
"A philosophy that assigns
a positive value to death"

00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:04.960
Now, this one is so stupid,

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:06.440
it's tempting to skip over,

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:08.250
but it's actually really important.

00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:10.950
It underpins an attitude that you
encounter on the forum constantly:

00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:13.010
the idea that life is so horrible

00:10:13.010 --> 00:10:15.010
it's amoral to act in
any way that might

00:10:15.010 --> 00:10:16.810
dissuade someone from
ending their life.

00:10:17.170 --> 00:10:18.880
In practice, it's used constantly

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:20.950
to chastise those who
recommend therapy,

00:10:20.950 --> 00:10:23.260
or to suggest that there
might be a reason to live.

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:24.800
In fact, on this forum,

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:26.120
suggesting there's a reason to live

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:28.270
is about the most gauche
thing you could possibly say.

00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:29.390
And last,

00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:30.930
(and least)

00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:32.640
libertarianism.

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:35.150
"The belief that the individual
is the owner of their own body"

00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:37.760
"and has the right to dispose
of it however they see fit."

00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:38.710
Um...

00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:40.960
It wouldn't be my go-to
summary of libertarianism.

00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:42.310
Uh, there's obviously some kind of

00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:44.190
'personal freedom' connection
being made here,

00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:46.210
for those who might already
be in that headspace,

00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:47.510
I don't know.

00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:48.490
Feels a bit tacked on.

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:50.780
Now, along with this is the
forum's attitude towards

00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:52.620
all mental health
and recovery services.

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:55.300
In a nutshell, if you're
thinking of ending your life,

00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:56.800
the predominant opinion on the forum

00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:59.340
is that you should not speak
to anyone about your thoughts,

00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:00.420
because if you do,

00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:02.140
they're going to lock
you up in a psych ward.

00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:04.270
This isn't directly
expressed in the site's

00:11:04.270 --> 00:11:05.840
official link to recovery options,

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:08.420
where, at least, they provide
a few hotline numbers

00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:09.360
as well as

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:11.380
zany pseudoscience alternatives like

00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:13.200
microdosing LSD and

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:15.070
MDMA-assisted therapy.

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:17.880
No, if you want to get a sense
of what the admins approve of,

00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:19.330
just look at their moderation.

00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:20.220
What they permit

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:22.500
and what many of the
most prolific members say.

00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:23.720
For example,

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:24.910
when one user posted:

00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:26.180
"I learned long ago that there's"

00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:28.290
"absolutely no point
in talking to people."

00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:29.680
"Doctors, psychiatrists,"

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:30.690
"family, friends,"

00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:31.620
"it doesn't matter,"

00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:32.630
"they never listen..."

00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:34.530
"they seem to prefer
taking others hostage"

00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:37.030
"over respecting someone's
decision to CTB."

00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:38.530
In response to this,

00:11:38.530 --> 00:11:40.110
one of the most prolific members,

00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:42.780
who's posted over 16,000
messages on this site,

00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:43.640
responded:

00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:44.870
"I agree with this."

00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:46.790
"People will never be
able to understand"

00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:48.620
"as they are not in
a similar situation"

00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:50.170
"and if you open up
about your suffering"

00:11:50.170 --> 00:11:52.560
"it's likely that you will just
get invalidated in some way."

00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:54.230
I'll get back to this member,

00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:57.020
who I'll refer to as 'cake123' later.

00:11:57.230 --> 00:11:59.040
It really only takes
a few minutes of

00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:01.380
viewing various posts
on their responses

00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:03.200
for you to become exposed to this

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:04.670
anti-help perspective,

00:12:04.670 --> 00:12:05.940
and only a few hours more

00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:07.680
for it to become
crystallized in your mind.

00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:10.050
I understood it perfectly
well before I discovered

00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:11.970
their four ‘adjacent’ philosophies.

00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:14.510
So, are all the members
of the site like this?

00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:15.100
No.

00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:17.520
There are some who strongly
disagree with this mindset.

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:19.080
Some who do call it toxic.

00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:21.280
The moderator's response
to this criticism

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:22.890
is nearly always to emphasize that

00:12:22.890 --> 00:12:24.580
free speech is of greater importance.

00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:26.270
The 'free speech' argument is,

00:12:26.270 --> 00:12:28.070
again, another smokescreen.

00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:30.280
It allows the moderators
to promote and encourage

00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:31.930
seriously dangerous conversations,

00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:34.430
while quietly banning those
who protested too much.

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:35.750
"I need to CTB"

00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:36.990
"but I don't have a method."

00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:38.820
"[Method A] is just unavailable."

00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:41.240
"I've tried so hard with it
but it's never worked out."

00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:43.440
"[Method B], [Method C]
and [Method D]"

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:45.830
"are all unbelievably difficult
to get your hands on."

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:48.580
"Everything else is too
painful, slow or unreliable."

00:12:48.830 --> 00:12:49.920
"This isn't fair."

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:51.360
"I truly hate it here."

00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:53.750
"If you really want to
leave this world,"

00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:55.100
"the method will find you."

00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:56.350
"And you will not fail."

00:12:56.510 --> 00:12:57.530
"Try [Method E]."

00:12:57.530 --> 00:12:58.420
"All you need..."

00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:00.220
And then this is followed
with instructions

00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:02.340
and a video to give
more concrete specifics.

00:13:02.770 --> 00:13:03.850
Free speech, indeed.

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:05.930
Free speech that
directly contradicts

00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:09.520
the supposed core policy of not
suggesting, helping or encouraging.

00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:11.460
This is what SS

00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:12.560
actually is.

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:15.320
And this pretense of valuing
free speech above all else

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:17.340
is persuasive to many on the forum,

00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:18.990
but what a lot of them don't realize

00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:20.570
is that regardless of their views,

00:13:20.570 --> 00:13:22.390
they're participating
in a percentage game.

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:23.510
As I mentioned,

00:13:23.510 --> 00:13:25.440
the site gets millions
of page views a month.

00:13:25.650 --> 00:13:26.770
And of those who sign up,

00:13:26.770 --> 00:13:28.790
a significant portion
are clearly attracted

00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:30.250
to the most extreme ideas.

00:13:30.630 --> 00:13:31.590
That's the problem.

00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:33.210
The fact that some members
have the freedom

00:13:33.210 --> 00:13:35.780
to call these ideas toxic
without getting banned

00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:37.560
doesn't make that problem any better.

00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:39.140
The stakes are just too high.

00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:42.000
When a minor is assisted in
ending their life on the forum,

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.500
that's not the unfortunate
price of free speech,

00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:46.870
that's a catastrophic
moderation failure.

00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:48.440
Now, the death of Bobby C

00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:50.300
is a perfect example of this failure.

00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:52.160
You see, months before he died,

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:54.180
he had been planning how he
was going to end his life

00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:56.030
with the help of others on the site.

00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:57.680
First, let me show you

00:13:57.680 --> 00:13:58.800
how the scaremongering

00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:00.960
and blatant misinformation
about seeking help

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:02.110
influenced his thinking:

00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:04.750
"What are the consequences
of failing to CTB?"

00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:07.100
"I don't have a therapist
or anything like that."

00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:08.990
"I'm considered 'normal'
by most people."

00:14:09.170 --> 00:14:10.500
"However, I absolutely"

00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:12.990
"do not want to risk
hospitalisation if I fail."

00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:15.470
"I'm scared to reach out to
any therapist or help service"

00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:17.300
"in case they force
me into a hospital"

00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:20.060
"because they'll completely
prevent my attempts to CTB."

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:22.680
Now, this is the
reddest of red flags,

00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:24.160
because he's just admitted that

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:25.790
he's never sought help ever.

00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:26.940
But the first response?

00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:29.270
"Your biggest consequence
is going to be either"

00:14:29.270 --> 00:14:30.250
"permanent damage"

00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:31.360
"or hospitalisation."

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:33.610
"Both can be avoided with
enough research and planning."

00:14:34.070 --> 00:14:34.900
There is at least

00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:36.750
one message that advises caution:

00:14:36.950 --> 00:14:38.850
"If there's a part of you
that wants to get help,"

00:14:38.850 --> 00:14:39.560
"seek it."

00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:42.220
"Don't make a permanent decision
if you're not entirely sure."

00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:43.970
"There are people you can talk to"

00:14:43.970 --> 00:14:45.840
"who won't automatically
hospitalise you..."

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:47.410
However, the person who said this

00:14:47.410 --> 00:14:48.740
then felt it pertinent to

00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:50.420
'balance' this statement

00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:52.290
by describing how
terrible and uncaring

00:14:52.290 --> 00:14:54.360
the mental health services
in their country are.

00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:56.810
And that there was the sole instance

00:14:56.810 --> 00:14:58.660
where someone suggested to Bobby C

00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:00.450
that he might reconsider his plans.

00:15:00.450 --> 00:15:01.760
It had been mentioned once,

00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:02.830
and once was enough.

00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:05.210
The rest of the comments
are all encouragement

00:15:05.210 --> 00:15:06.640
along with a large dose of

00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:08.840
anti-therapy and anti-help dogma.

00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:11.440
Unfortunately, Bobby C
was much more convinced

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:13.630
by the suggestion that
he should plan properly,

00:15:13.990 --> 00:15:14.830
so he did.

00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:16.770
There's a whole other
thread where he,

00:15:16.770 --> 00:15:18.220
assisted by a few others,

00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:20.010
assessed the best approach
he should take

00:15:20.010 --> 00:15:21.730
to carrying through
his chosen method.

00:15:21.730 --> 00:15:23.890
Again, I'm not going to
detail the method he used.

00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:25.220
The only thing I'll say

00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:26.990
is that I found it
unbelievably shocking

00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:28.270
due to how violent it was.

00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:30.570
It has honestly stuck
with me ever since.

00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:32.790
The reaction on the
forum was more like

00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:33.560
admiration.

00:15:33.730 --> 00:15:35.100
As one commenter put it:

00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:37.400
"...you got BALLS to
choose this method."

00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:37.950
For me,

00:15:37.950 --> 00:15:39.600
the most upsetting thing
about this site

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:41.080
are the ‘Goodbye’ threads.

00:15:41.390 --> 00:15:42.770
The first page I ever saw,

00:15:42.770 --> 00:15:43.960
the one by Bobby C,

00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:45.010
was a goodbye thread.

00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:46.140
As you can imagine,

00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:47.910
goodbye threads are posted by users

00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:50.140
who are ready to carry
through their final plans.

00:15:50.450 --> 00:15:52.470
They're avoided by many
people on the site

00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:53.940
who find them too upsetting.

00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:56.020
What's particularly
notable about them

00:15:56.020 --> 00:15:58.090
is that you don't often
see anyone make an appeal

00:15:58.090 --> 00:16:00.170
for the original poster
to reconsider,

00:16:00.170 --> 00:16:02.180
(they're called 'goodbye'
threads for a reason)

00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:04.450
because, in the logic
of this community,

00:16:04.450 --> 00:16:05.740
the point of no return has been

00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:07.240
well and truly passed.

00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:08.730
And on every one of these threads,

00:16:08.730 --> 00:16:10.580
every single one that I've read,

00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:12.670
the same prolific toxic member

00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:13.840
I mentioned earlier,

00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:15.080
cake123,

00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:17.620
will respond with the
variation on this line:

00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:18.980
"Farewell."

00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:21.090
"I hope that you find the
freedom from your suffering"

00:16:21.090 --> 00:16:22.090
"that you wish for."

00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:23.920
Now, it's not hard to see

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:25.890
how all of this could
be described as a cult.

00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:27.780
There are three telltale signs:

00:16:28.170 --> 00:16:28.640
First,

00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:31.170
it has a highly peculiar
alternative ideology

00:16:31.170 --> 00:16:33.280
which runs contrary to
mainstream thinking.

00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:34.160
In particular,

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:36.540
that inversion of morality
I spoke about earlier

00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:38.800
that you shouldn't stand in
the way of someone dying.

00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:39.810
Second,

00:16:39.810 --> 00:16:42.230
a ridiculous hostility to
mental health professionals

00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:43.870
and the idea of treatment.

00:16:44.110 --> 00:16:45.830
You see this a lot with Scientology.

00:16:45.830 --> 00:16:47.300
Their ideology runs contrary to

00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:49.100
mainstream mental health
treatment too,

00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:50.650
so they viciously attack it.

00:16:50.650 --> 00:16:51.980
It's Cult 101.

00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:53.520
Your ideology will seem stronger

00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:55.660
if you clobber all
competing ways of thinking.

00:16:55.660 --> 00:16:56.400
Third,

00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:58.070
and most telling for cults,

00:16:58.070 --> 00:16:59.540
including Scientology,

00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:01.950
cutting people off from
their support networks.

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:04.010
Medical professionals
and therapists?

00:17:04.010 --> 00:17:05.380
Well, they only care about money,

00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:07.500
and they're going to lock you up if
you tell them what you're thinking.

00:17:07.910 --> 00:17:08.900
Your parents?

00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:10.560
They're the ones who did this
to you in the first place

00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:13.180
by selfishly dragging you
into this meaningless world.

00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:14.310
You can't trust them.

00:17:14.610 --> 00:17:16.680
And those preventing you
from harming yourself?

00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:17.990
They're assaulting your freedom

00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:19.540
to do what you want with your body.

00:17:19.950 --> 00:17:21.990
And in order to lock you
in as much as possible,

00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:24.630
it's always assumed that if
you register on the site,

00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:27.040
you must have exhausted
all other options.

00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:27.750
I mean,

00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:28.960
why else would you be here?

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:31.580
It would be immoral at this stage
to stand in your way, right?

00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:33.180
As one forum member put it:

00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:34.330
"it should be assumed that"

00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:35.830
"anyone posting a goodbye thread"

00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:37.600
"or asking for advice on a method"

00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:39.890
"has already considered their
'options' to get better..."

00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:42.110
"we should give the individuals
the benefit of the doubt"

00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:43.830
"in assuming that they
made the best choice"

00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:45.160
"they believe they could have made."

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:47.800
And just in case all of
the above doesn't work,

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:49.770
members are reminded
on a daily basis:

00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:51.160
"Life is terrible".

00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:52.560
"Death is beautiful".

00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:54.800
And if you think I'm
exaggerating in any way,

00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:56.650
here's a post by cake123,

00:17:56.650 --> 00:17:59.010
who the admins actively
protect and defend

00:17:59.010 --> 00:18:00.200
when other people on the forum

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:02.350
complained about the toxic
nature of their posts:

00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:03.900
"This is the truth."

00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:05.690
"The fact is that a peaceful s---cide"

00:18:05.690 --> 00:18:07.250
"would solve everything in life"

00:18:07.250 --> 00:18:09.110
"and it would be the
best outcome possible"

00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:10.380
"to pass away peacefully"

00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:12.720
"and be permanently free
from this existence"

00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:14.430
"without having the
ability to suffer"

00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:15.880
"and struggle in any way."

00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:19.460
"Death is really the only solution
when life itself is the problem..."

00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:21.230
"The fact that life exists"

00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:22.490
"is a cruel mistake"

00:18:22.490 --> 00:18:24.390
"and it's wrong to value
life in any way..."

00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:25.840
"and these false beliefs"

00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:27.770
"prevent others from
achieving true peace"

00:18:27.770 --> 00:18:29.170
"which can only be achieved"

00:18:29.170 --> 00:18:30.460
"by leaving this world."

00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:31.850
This person weighs in

00:18:31.850 --> 00:18:33.860
on just about every
thread on the forum

00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:35.960
to actively encourage
others to take their lives

00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:37.160
as quickly as possible.

00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:38.510
As I mentioned already,

00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:40.770
this person has over 16,000 posts.

00:18:40.990 --> 00:18:42.530
When one user asked for advice on

00:18:42.530 --> 00:18:44.290
whether they should spend
a lot of time researching

00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:46.040
how to end their life
in a painless way,

00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:46.830
or just

00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:48.000
"get it over with",

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.740
cake123's response was:

00:18:50.050 --> 00:18:51.420
"I would personally just try and"

00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:53.420
"go for the most
straightforward plan possible"

00:18:53.970 --> 00:18:55.230
And that leads me to the next

00:18:55.230 --> 00:18:56.440
inevitable question.

00:18:56.980 --> 00:18:58.810
How do we know this person
isn't a psychopath?

00:18:59.150 --> 00:19:00.120
Some middle-aged dude

00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:01.740
who gets a kick out
of being involved

00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:03.710
in as many young people's
deaths as possible?

00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:06.480
How do we know this person
isn't a card-carrying murderer?

00:19:06.770 --> 00:19:08.520
Because if there's one place
I think might be likely

00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:09.940
to attract those kinds of people,

00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:10.880
it's this place.

00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:13.050
It's not hard to grab
an anime character,

00:19:13.050 --> 00:19:13.970
say you're a young girl,

00:19:13.970 --> 00:19:15.460
and then tell people things like:

00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:16.410
"I agree with this."

00:19:16.410 --> 00:19:17.610
"It'll be better if you die."

00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:19.340
And with that in mind,

00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:20.650
let me now introduce you to

00:19:20.650 --> 00:19:21.990
a section on the site called:

00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:23.040
'Partners',

00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:24.640
a listing of people
all over the world

00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:26.850
looking to meet up with
someone else in their country

00:19:26.850 --> 00:19:28.440
so they can do the deed together.

00:19:28.790 --> 00:19:30.400
People post the country they live in,

00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:31.760
the method they'd like to use,

00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:33.980
and anyone interested can
send them a private message

00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:35.140
to work out the details.

00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:37.060
Only just a few weeks ago,

00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:38.760
a man named Craig McKinley

00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:41.260
was given a prison sentence
in the high court in Glasgow

00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:43.410
for using the 'Partner'
section on SS

00:19:43.410 --> 00:19:45.140
to lure a woman over to his flat

00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:46.710
under the pretense
of helping her to

00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:48.350
practice a s---cide attempt.

00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:50.550
He choked her until
she became unconscious,

00:19:50.550 --> 00:19:52.110
and then sexually assaulted her.

00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:54.020
And then he did it again
to a different woman.

00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:55.740
The other day, I found a post

00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:57.550
by a guy on the 'Partner'
section who said

00:19:57.550 --> 00:19:59.320
he'd be willing to fly to you

00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:00.770
if you live in a country where

00:20:00.770 --> 00:20:02.600
a particular method
is easy to achieve.

00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:05.370
Apparently, this would
require some preparation.

00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:06.360
Quote:

00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:07.370
"We could search for a forest"

00:20:07.370 --> 00:20:09.430
"where we can test [this method] together"

00:20:09.570 --> 00:20:10.760
Something tells me

00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:12.990
only one person's coming
out of that forest.

00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:16.600
Now, when considering
everything I've said so far,

00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:18.600
one obvious question
that pops up is:

00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:21.520
do the moderators do anything
to protect vulnerable users?

00:20:21.910 --> 00:20:23.380
Let's dig into that for a moment.

00:20:23.730 --> 00:20:25.200
First, the site states that

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:27.200
only those of "sound mind"

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:28.700
will be allowed to join the forum.

00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:30.410
Now, the term 'sound mind'

00:20:30.410 --> 00:20:32.600
is used to describe
a person's ability

00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:34.500
to reasonably understand
their surroundings

00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:36.400
and act rationally in
their own interest.

00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:38.650
It's an important thing
to determine in

00:20:38.650 --> 00:20:39.990
contentious legal situations,

00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:40.550
like

00:20:40.550 --> 00:20:42.890
when a person makes an
unusual change to their will

00:20:42.890 --> 00:20:44.620
or when they refuse
medical treatment.

00:20:44.930 --> 00:20:47.500
Did the person act in
sound mind at that moment,

00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:49.400
or were their actions
negatively influenced

00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:50.530
by something like

00:20:50.530 --> 00:20:51.330
coercion,

00:20:51.330 --> 00:20:52.078
bereavement,

00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:52.530
shock,

00:20:52.530 --> 00:20:53.660
extreme stress,

00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:54.400
psychosis,

00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:56.040
or other types of personal crisis?

00:20:56.740 --> 00:20:57.840
Second, on the forum's

00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:00.140
'Membership Requirements'
section, it states that

00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:03.060
no one with "intellectual
disabilities" can join either.

00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:05.340
Now, defining the term
'intellectual disability'

00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:06.870
is a tiny bit problematic here,

00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:08.380
because it's sometimes used

00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:09.860
way too broadly to refer to

00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:11.570
any kind of neurodivergence.

00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:13.150
I suspected the admins intended

00:21:13.150 --> 00:21:14.650
a much narrower definition

00:21:14.650 --> 00:21:17.970
to refer to those who are unable to
function independently without care.

00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:19.660
However, I can't be sure,

00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:20.920
so let's put that to one side.

00:21:21.250 --> 00:21:22.370
What's important is that

00:21:22.370 --> 00:21:23.810
by placing this rule here,

00:21:23.810 --> 00:21:25.430
the moderators are trying
to make it look like

00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:27.580
they're taking steps
to turn away those

00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:29.280
who might be very prone to being

00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:31.230
manipulated by others on the forum.

00:21:31.230 --> 00:21:32.630
To give a famous example,

00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:34.780
in the state of Georgia in 2006,

00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:36.530
a man named Roberto Rocha,

00:21:36.530 --> 00:21:38.560
a 20 year old who
worked as a landscaper,

00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:39.650
was coerced by police

00:21:39.650 --> 00:21:41.460
into giving a false
confession for murder.

00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:43.410
A murder it was later revealed

00:21:43.410 --> 00:21:44.870
he couldn't possibly have committed

00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:46.480
because he wasn't in the
country at the time.

00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:48.480
Now, Roberto's comprehension skills

00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:50.890
were assessed to be at the
same level as a 12 year old.

00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:53.050
The police extracted the confession

00:21:53.050 --> 00:21:53.740
by telling him

00:21:53.740 --> 00:21:55.330
they already knew he was guilty

00:21:55.330 --> 00:21:57.690
and that it was in his
best interests to confess.

00:21:58.100 --> 00:21:59.270
He did protest at first,

00:21:59.270 --> 00:22:01.160
but eventually gave way
due to the pressure.

00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:03.800
A person like Roberto has
the communication skills

00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:05.840
to pass anonymously on this forum,

00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:06.750
no problem.

00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:09.530
But apart from disabilities
that affect comprehension,

00:22:09.530 --> 00:22:12.110
there are all kinds of other
vulnerable people out there.

00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:12.910
For example,

00:22:12.910 --> 00:22:14.840
those who suffer from
a form of psychosis,

00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:17.580
like the condition currently
defined as schizophrenia.

00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:19.130
A person with this condition

00:22:19.130 --> 00:22:20.870
in the middle of a psychotic episode

00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:23.770
might be highly susceptible to
suggestion and encouragement

00:22:23.770 --> 00:22:24.980
during that episode.

00:22:25.390 --> 00:22:27.130
So let's now ask the question:

00:22:27.130 --> 00:22:29.120
Does this forum take
appropriate steps

00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:31.470
to protect those who are
vulnerable to coercion?

00:22:32.810 --> 00:22:33.480
No.

00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:36.050
It's difficult to imagine a
way they could fail any worse.

00:22:36.490 --> 00:22:37.630
I'll start with the bad,

00:22:37.630 --> 00:22:39.140
we'll move on to the appalling,

00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:40.870
and we'll finish with the
catastrophic.

00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:42.550
Let's go back to the term

00:22:42.550 --> 00:22:43.440
'sound mind'.

00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:45.060
When treating a patient who says

00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:46.650
they've considered ending their life,

00:22:46.650 --> 00:22:49.120
a mental health professional
will seek to determine

00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:50.830
whether or not the
patient is experiencing

00:22:50.830 --> 00:22:52.300
a mental health crisis,

00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:53.470
which is a state of mind

00:22:53.470 --> 00:22:55.800
distinctly different to
the norm for that person.

00:22:56.170 --> 00:22:58.580
There's a massively heightened
danger of self-harm

00:22:58.580 --> 00:23:00.120
during a mental health crisis,

00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:01.960
because to the person
experiencing it,

00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:02.810
the future

00:23:02.810 --> 00:23:04.640
or any possibility of a future

00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:05.860
can get really obscured.

00:23:06.150 --> 00:23:08.510
Life can seem like a
moment-to-moment existence,

00:23:08.510 --> 00:23:10.250
and recovery can seem impossible.

00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:12.100
As Professor Rory O’Connor,

00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:14.430
who leads the S---cidal Behaviour
Research Laboratory

00:23:14.430 --> 00:23:16.420
at the University
of Glasgow, puts it:

00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:17.850
"People... take their own lives"

00:23:17.850 --> 00:23:19.840
"when they can see
no end to their pain,"

00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:21.150
"when they feel trapped by it"

00:23:21.150 --> 00:23:22.320
"and that there is no way out."

00:23:22.730 --> 00:23:23.730
"Like physical pain,"

00:23:23.730 --> 00:23:26.240
"there is only so much mental
pain that we can withstand"

00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:27.620
"and, when we reach our limit,"

00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:28.600
"something has to give."

00:23:28.910 --> 00:23:30.410
"Sadly, for too many people,"

00:23:30.410 --> 00:23:31.780
"it is life that gives."

00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:32.550
The thing is,

00:23:32.550 --> 00:23:34.450
once a mental health crisis is over,

00:23:34.450 --> 00:23:36.680
this view is nowhere near
as black and white.

00:23:36.970 --> 00:23:39.610
To quote a representative at
the Samaritans that I spoke to:

00:23:39.610 --> 00:23:42.050
"A mental health crisis
can feel very intense,"

00:23:42.050 --> 00:23:43.640
"but these feelings are treatable,"

00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:44.580
"things change,"

00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:45.730
"the feelings pass,"

00:23:45.730 --> 00:23:46.730
"things can get better."

00:23:47.110 --> 00:23:49.000
To quote Professor
Rory O’Connor again:

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.770
"For most people, s---icide
risk is usually short-term"

00:23:51.770 --> 00:23:53.600
"and linked to a specific situation,"

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:55.400
"often an interpersonal crisis."

00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:58.470
"While s---cidal thoughts may
come back again for some people,"

00:23:58.470 --> 00:24:00.650
"the vast majority will
make a full recovery."

00:24:01.090 --> 00:24:01.630
So,

00:24:01.630 --> 00:24:03.870
given the nature of a
mental health crisis,

00:24:03.870 --> 00:24:06.370
where the ability to act
in one’s own self interest

00:24:06.370 --> 00:24:08.190
can be temporarily impaired,

00:24:08.190 --> 00:24:11.580
this question of whether a
user is acting in 'sound mind'

00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:12.310
really is,

00:24:12.310 --> 00:24:13.370
for this forum,

00:24:13.370 --> 00:24:14.550
THE question.

00:24:14.550 --> 00:24:16.120
This is something I
want to put to those

00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:17.850
who are active on the SS forum now:

00:24:18.210 --> 00:24:19.500
How can you determine

00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:21.100
if someone is of sound mind,

00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:22.760
since all they have
to do is tick a box

00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:24.460
saying they are when they register?

00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:26.370
How long does that tick box last?

00:24:26.810 --> 00:24:28.180
If someone ticks it once,

00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:29.920
is it still true six months later?

00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:30.530
Worse,

00:24:30.530 --> 00:24:33.220
how do you know that a person
you've been speaking to for months

00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:35.120
who's now saying they
want to end their life

00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:38.170
isn't someone who has an
abundance of communication skills,

00:24:38.170 --> 00:24:39.880
but, unbeknownst to you,

00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:42.670
has a condition that makes them
highly susceptible to suggestion?

00:24:42.930 --> 00:24:44.320
Someone who might find it difficult

00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:46.200
to critically assess a statement like,

00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:47.900
"Death is really the only solution"

00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:49.510
"when life itself is the problem,"

00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:51.220
"it's wrong to value life in any way"?

00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:53.320
But all this can be put to one side,

00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:54.040
because

00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:55.940
I haven't yet got to
the catastrophic.

00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:56.800
You see,

00:24:56.800 --> 00:24:59.030
the question of registration
is immaterial,

00:24:59.030 --> 00:25:01.060
because the conversations on SS

00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:03.310
are publicly available
for everyone to see.

00:25:03.620 --> 00:25:04.780
And given that it has between

00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:07.070
6 and 10 million page views a month,

00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:08.710
this raises an even bigger question

00:25:08.710 --> 00:25:10.650
for those active on
the forum right now:

00:25:11.450 --> 00:25:13.680
How do you know the
conversations on SS

00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:15.120
haven't directly led to the death of

00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:17.360
multiple people with
intellectual disabilities,

00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:19.470
people experiencing a
mental health crisis,

00:25:19.470 --> 00:25:21.150
people suffering some
kind of psychosis,

00:25:21.150 --> 00:25:22.050
or minors,

00:25:22.050 --> 00:25:23.870
none of whom ever tried
to sign up to the site

00:25:23.870 --> 00:25:25.090
because they didn't need to?

00:25:25.370 --> 00:25:26.480
You can't know.

00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:27.700
And this is the point.

00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:28.950
The point that makes me confident

00:25:28.950 --> 00:25:31.090
that there's no justification
on moral grounds

00:25:31.090 --> 00:25:33.220
to continue as an
active member on SS.

00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:34.660
And if this makes you angry,

00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:37.400
that anger should be directed
at the moderators of SS,

00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:39.330
because they've already
weighed this up,

00:25:39.330 --> 00:25:41.250
and they've decided, it's fine as is,

00:25:41.250 --> 00:25:43.350
no one should be protected
from this information.

00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:46.440
You deserve moderators with a
baseline of rudimentary competence,

00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:47.560
but you didn't get that.

00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:50.320
They failed you in the most
serious way imaginable.

00:25:50.620 --> 00:25:51.600
And to this point,

00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:52.430
just a month ago,

00:25:52.430 --> 00:25:54.470
a group of users
opened up a new thread

00:25:54.470 --> 00:25:55.910
to plead on the forum

00:25:55.910 --> 00:25:57.110
to make it private.

00:25:57.110 --> 00:25:59.150
Some pointed out that this
would protect minors

00:25:59.150 --> 00:26:00.320
and those in crisis

00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:02.200
and those who might act impulsively.

00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:04.010
The site admin’s response?

00:26:04.010 --> 00:26:05.670
"Not enough moderators
to take care of"

00:26:05.670 --> 00:26:08.280
"the huge waves of new
registrations that will occur"

00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:10.250
"as soon as we make
the forum private."

00:26:10.250 --> 00:26:12.060
"We have a lot of
non-member guests here"

00:26:12.060 --> 00:26:14.470
"and every time we made the
forum private in the past,"

00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:16.210
"the registration queue
would turn into"

00:26:16.210 --> 00:26:18.250
"3-digit numbers very quickly."

00:26:18.250 --> 00:26:19.780
cake123's response?

00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:21.400
"People are already suffering enough"

00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:23.630
"without having to make
an account on here."

00:26:25.060 --> 00:26:26.950
Everyone's got their
priorities, I suppose.

00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:31.680
So I imagine at this point

00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:32.920
you're probably thinking,

00:26:33.270 --> 00:26:34.220
"Who runs this site?"

00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:36.350
"And how has it not
been shut down yet?"

00:26:36.850 --> 00:26:37.920
Well, before I get to that,

00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:39.170
I need to first discuss

00:26:39.170 --> 00:26:40.740
the instruction threads,

00:26:40.740 --> 00:26:42.560
the part of the site
that most obviously

00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:45.330
crosses the line into
illegality in most countries.

00:26:45.810 --> 00:26:46.680
As you can imagine,

00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:48.510
these threads provide
instructions on

00:26:48.510 --> 00:26:50.840
the various different ways
that you can end your own life.

00:26:51.170 --> 00:26:52.330
They're very detailed,

00:26:52.330 --> 00:26:53.480
they're very clinical,

00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:54.850
and often very tough to read.

00:26:55.110 --> 00:26:56.650
Now, here I need to be careful.

00:26:56.920 --> 00:26:59.150
Guidelines on media
reporting on this topic

00:26:59.150 --> 00:27:00.650
are very clear that it's dangerous

00:27:00.650 --> 00:27:02.280
to openly discuss methods

00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:03.600
and names of services,

00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:05.930
because those in crisis
may take that information

00:27:05.930 --> 00:27:07.130
and use it immediately

00:27:07.130 --> 00:27:08.880
without hearing anything
else I have to say.

00:27:09.210 --> 00:27:10.340
For this reason, my description

00:27:10.340 --> 00:27:12.210
is going to have to
be vague in places,

00:27:12.210 --> 00:27:14.520
but the substance of my
point will remain intact.

00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:16.500
Let me map this out.

00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:18.450
When you first arrive on the forum,

00:27:18.450 --> 00:27:20.010
one of the first things
you'll notice is

00:27:20.010 --> 00:27:22.040
how much the site and
many of its members

00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:24.010
keep pushing a certain method.

00:27:24.010 --> 00:27:24.980
The method that is,

00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:26.050
to put it lightly,

00:27:26.050 --> 00:27:27.350
complicated to achieve.

00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:30.630
Now, after enough exposure to this
particular type of conversation,

00:27:30.630 --> 00:27:32.740
you'll inevitably follow
the breadcrumb trail

00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:34.430
to the relevant instruction thread

00:27:34.430 --> 00:27:37.020
that promises to show you how
to accomplish this method.

00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:37.800
However,

00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:38.790
these instructions,

00:27:38.790 --> 00:27:40.030
unlike many of the others,

00:27:40.030 --> 00:27:41.120
are incomplete.

00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:43.690
In order to get access to
the complete instructions,

00:27:43.690 --> 00:27:45.770
you're then directed
to a different forum,

00:27:45.770 --> 00:27:47.700
which I'm going to call 'SS2',

00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:50.850
that requires a subscription of
nearly a hundred dollars to join.

00:27:51.210 --> 00:27:53.770
Now, having worked in
technology for a long time,

00:27:53.770 --> 00:27:56.030
and knowing a thing or
two about social media,

00:27:56.030 --> 00:27:57.760
I have a pretty decent
understanding of

00:27:57.760 --> 00:27:58.800
traffic funnels.

00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:00.110
And, to me, this provides

00:28:00.110 --> 00:28:02.160
a potential alternative
explanation as to

00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:04.290
why the SS forum has
not been made private.

00:28:04.650 --> 00:28:06.930
Because it would close off
an enormous amount of traffic

00:28:06.930 --> 00:28:10.240
that would otherwise find its way
to the SS2 subscription service.

00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:11.520
So, to put it mildly,

00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:14.240
I'd love some clarification
from those who run both forums

00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:16.700
(both of them will
definitely see this video)

00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:18.700
about the exact nature
of their relationship.

00:28:19.010 --> 00:28:20.590
Now, along with the
instruction threads,

00:28:20.590 --> 00:28:22.680
SS also has a poorly
concealed system

00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:24.750
for guiding you to
sellers who can provide

00:28:24.750 --> 00:28:27.240
the highly advertised method
I've been speaking about.

00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:29.180
It's one of the top
topics of conversation.

00:28:29.460 --> 00:28:31.180
Here's a recent post
I found of a user

00:28:31.180 --> 00:28:33.170
offering to provide
a source to buy from.

00:28:33.450 --> 00:28:34.740
Names of specific sellers

00:28:34.740 --> 00:28:36.150
are described using acronyms.

00:28:36.410 --> 00:28:38.510
For example, I found
an obscure archive

00:28:38.510 --> 00:28:40.360
where users discussed buying from

00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:41.020
'A',

00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:43.700
which at that time apparently
stood for 'Alejandro'.

00:28:43.890 --> 00:28:45.380
Here's a screenshot
of the site admin

00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:47.130
discussing Alejandro openly,

00:28:47.130 --> 00:28:47.880
which means

00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:49.840
the site admin is actively
participating in

00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:51.500
helping users find sellers.

00:28:51.730 --> 00:28:52.690
What's also clear

00:28:52.690 --> 00:28:54.620
is that contact details
for these sellers

00:28:54.620 --> 00:28:56.950
change constantly to stay
ahead of the authorities.

00:28:57.220 --> 00:28:58.800
In a very recent forum post,

00:28:58.800 --> 00:28:59.840
one person asked,

00:29:00.150 --> 00:29:02.260
"Does anyone have the
new email address for D?"

00:29:02.620 --> 00:29:04.840
It's then hinted obliquely
that you shouldn't really

00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:07.430
mention the existence of
these sources in public threads.

00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:09.900
There's actually a rule
on the site that says:

00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:11.290
"It is against forum rules"

00:29:11.290 --> 00:29:12.780
"to post links to sources"

00:29:12.780 --> 00:29:15.510
"or to mention where you can
find sources in the public forum."

00:29:15.910 --> 00:29:16.520
Well,

00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:17.490
that's interesting.

00:29:17.890 --> 00:29:19.850
There's a place where
you can find sources?

00:29:20.060 --> 00:29:22.060
After creating a new
profile on the site,

00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:23.970
I eventually found
a guy who sold me

00:29:23.970 --> 00:29:25.680
the means for a specific method,

00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:27.190
with zero questions asked.

00:29:27.510 --> 00:29:29.260
I documented this entire process,

00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:31.070
but of course I can't show it here.

00:29:31.340 --> 00:29:32.410
The method I purchased,

00:29:32.410 --> 00:29:34.940
(which is supposed to be
restricted in the U.K., by the way)

00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:36.130
arrived at my door

00:29:36.130 --> 00:29:37.710
just as I was finishing
up this video.

00:29:38.390 --> 00:29:40.380
MARTIN: It's weird that
someone sent this to me,

00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:41.820
and its purpose was to kill me.

00:29:42.330 --> 00:29:43.540
So someone in the world has

00:29:43.540 --> 00:29:45.090
actively assisted me in dying.

00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:46.550
Um...

00:29:46.550 --> 00:29:48.620
And this is the first time
that's ever happened to me,

00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:49.410
you know?

00:29:49.710 --> 00:29:51.800
it's really chilling and
it feels incredibly weird,

00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:53.300
and I got a weird
feeling in my stomach,

00:29:53.900 --> 00:29:54.760
uh, looking at it.

00:29:54.940 --> 00:29:57.380
MARTIN (narrating): So, who's
responsible for setting up SS?

00:29:57.380 --> 00:29:59.190
Well, thankfully, in this case,

00:29:59.190 --> 00:30:00.150
we do have answers.

00:30:00.410 --> 00:30:02.350
In late 2021, the New York Times

00:30:02.350 --> 00:30:04.580
published an exposé
on the forum titled

00:30:04.580 --> 00:30:07.620
<i>'Where the Despairing Log On, and Learn Ways to Die'</i>

00:30:07.620 --> 00:30:09.570
by Megan Twohey and Gabriel Dance.

00:30:09.820 --> 00:30:11.200
You might recognize Megan Twohey

00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:13.570
as one of the two investigators
who broke the story about

00:30:13.570 --> 00:30:14.970
the Harvey Weinstein scandal.

00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:16.420
There's a movie about her now.

00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:18.410
Anyway, in this exposé,

00:30:18.410 --> 00:30:20.520
the identities of the two
people behind the site

00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:22.090
were revealed for the first time.

00:30:22.460 --> 00:30:23.200
The founder,

00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:25.050
who went by the nickname 'Marquise'

00:30:25.050 --> 00:30:26.510
was revealed to be a man named

00:30:26.510 --> 00:30:27.710
Lamarcus Small,

00:30:27.710 --> 00:30:29.740
who was 28 at the time
the report came out.

00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:31.400
The co-founder, 'Serge',

00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:32.920
was revealed to be a man named

00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:34.100
Diego Galante,

00:30:34.100 --> 00:30:35.180
who was 29.

00:30:35.450 --> 00:30:37.700
The report also verified 45 deaths,

00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:40.080
which they were able to
directly link to the SS forum,

00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:41.680
three of whom were minors.

00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:42.760
And with Bobby C,

00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:44.720
I can now add a fourth to that list.

00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:45.940
In a subsequent article,

00:30:45.940 --> 00:30:47.150
The New York Times mentioned that

00:30:47.150 --> 00:30:49.190
they have linked dozens
more deaths as well.

00:30:49.540 --> 00:30:50.620
We also know,

00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:53.500
due to an earlier BuzzFeed
article with Lamarcus and Diego

00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:55.280
back when their identities
weren't known,

00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:57.280
in a move I imagine they now regret,

00:30:57.280 --> 00:30:58.890
they admitted to being
responsible for

00:30:58.890 --> 00:31:00.590
setting up a number of other forums

00:31:00.590 --> 00:31:01.480
for...

00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:02.260
(wait for it...)

00:31:02.590 --> 00:31:03.390
incels.

00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:05.670
I'm not going to name
the forums here,

00:31:05.670 --> 00:31:07.030
but there are quite a few of them

00:31:07.030 --> 00:31:08.470
and they get a lot of traffic.

00:31:08.470 --> 00:31:09.970
They offer young men a place for

00:31:09.970 --> 00:31:10.960
misogynist, racist,

00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:12.980
homophobic and anti-semitic venting,

00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:15.950
with a heavy dose of pseudoscientific
nonsense thrown in too.

00:31:16.310 --> 00:31:18.650
The main Incel site is
for raging about women.

00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:21.030
Another forum is for
those who are unemployed.

00:31:21.350 --> 00:31:22.890
Then there's a body image forum

00:31:22.890 --> 00:31:24.640
where guys post shots of themselves

00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:26.080
so other guys can comment on whether

00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:27.910
they'd be likely to
attract a girl or not.

00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:29.780
All handled in an unhelpful

00:31:29.780 --> 00:31:31.120
and very toxic way,

00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:33.170
with a funnel for the most despairing

00:31:33.170 --> 00:31:34.660
that leads straight to SS.

00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:36.800
According to a report titled:

00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:37.840
<i>'The Incelosphere'</i>

00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:39.770
by the Center for
Countering Digital Hate,

00:31:39.770 --> 00:31:41.290
this network has been linked to

00:31:41.290 --> 00:31:43.150
at least one mass shooting too.

00:31:43.510 --> 00:31:44.700
It's also worth mentioning that

00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:45.960
Lamarcus and Diego

00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:47.670
both identify as incels.

00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:49.420
With the exception of SS,

00:31:49.420 --> 00:31:51.650
all these forums are
exclusively for men.

00:31:51.980 --> 00:31:54.440
So if you're a woman
currently on the SS forum,

00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:56.640
I would take a moment to
reflect on this fact:

00:31:56.870 --> 00:31:58.970
Of all the sites these guys set up,

00:31:58.970 --> 00:32:01.600
the only one to which
you are admitted to join

00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:03.720
is the one that encourages
you to kill yourself.

00:32:04.620 --> 00:32:06.870
So, after the New York Times
report came out,

00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:08.770
both Diego and Lamarcus announced

00:32:08.770 --> 00:32:10.230
that they were leaving the forum

00:32:10.230 --> 00:32:11.960
and handing it over to
someone else instead.

00:32:12.420 --> 00:32:13.590
The new person is the admin

00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:15.190
I've been discussing this whole time.

00:32:15.460 --> 00:32:17.370
We don't yet know a
lot about this person.

00:32:17.370 --> 00:32:19.180
It could just be Diego or Lamarcus

00:32:19.180 --> 00:32:20.970
using a different ProtonMail account.

00:32:20.970 --> 00:32:21.760
Who knows?

00:32:22.210 --> 00:32:23.610
So, to the next question:

00:32:23.610 --> 00:32:25.280
How is this site still up?

00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:27.900
And why do search engines
like Google still index it?

00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:29.320
Well, at present,

00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:31.560
neither are legally liable
for their content.

00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:32.900
It's protection afforded by

00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:36.370
Section 230 of Title 47 of
the United States Code,

00:32:36.370 --> 00:32:37.510
which shields platforms

00:32:37.510 --> 00:32:39.880
like Google or Facebook
or any other site

00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:41.110
for being held liable

00:32:41.110 --> 00:32:42.960
for the content published
by their users.

00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:44.640
It's a very important law,

00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:45.670
and, many argue,

00:32:45.670 --> 00:32:47.270
vital to the ability of the internet

00:32:47.270 --> 00:32:48.750
to function as we know it today.

00:32:49.170 --> 00:32:51.960
Trying to discuss the pros
and cons of Section 230 here

00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:54.650
would take us way too far from
the main point of this video.

00:32:54.650 --> 00:32:55.730
Suffice it to say

00:32:55.730 --> 00:32:58.030
that amending it is,
in practical terms,

00:32:58.030 --> 00:32:59.250
incredibly difficult,

00:32:59.620 --> 00:33:01.978
and doing so would not be
without negative consequences.

00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:02.860
However,

00:33:02.860 --> 00:33:05.420
expect to be hearing a lot
about this over the coming year,

00:33:05.420 --> 00:33:07.140
since there are already
two cases being

00:33:07.140 --> 00:33:09.420
considered by the
Supreme Court right now

00:33:09.420 --> 00:33:11.310
that revolve around Section 230.

00:33:11.310 --> 00:33:12.830
And there are more coming after that.

00:33:12.830 --> 00:33:14.520
I've put some useful
links in the description

00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:15.940
for those who want to learn more.

00:33:15.940 --> 00:33:16.580
Anyway,

00:33:16.580 --> 00:33:19.330
although it's not illegal
for Google to index SS,

00:33:19.330 --> 00:33:21.900
that's not to say they won't bow
to pressure from their users,

00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:22.900
us.

00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:24.370
As long as we shout loudly enough,

00:33:24.770 --> 00:33:27.440
I personally think Google,
Microsoft, and others

00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:29.890
should stop indexing this
site and those like it,

00:33:29.890 --> 00:33:31.210
because by doing so,

00:33:31.210 --> 00:33:33.870
they're providing vulnerable
people as well as minors

00:33:33.870 --> 00:33:36.730
with a direct link to instructions
to end their own lives.

00:33:37.050 --> 00:33:38.870
Yes, legally they can...

00:33:38.870 --> 00:33:39.800
but they shouldn't.

00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:41.730
And there's increasing
need for action.

00:33:41.730 --> 00:33:44.370
In the U.K., among
15 to 19 year olds,

00:33:44.370 --> 00:33:45.880
the rate of taking one's own life

00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:48.360
has sharply increased by 35%

00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:50.310
throughout 2020 and 2021.

00:33:50.730 --> 00:33:51.620
In the U.S.,

00:33:51.620 --> 00:33:52.890
the overall rate has increased

00:33:52.890 --> 00:33:55.580
also by 35% since 1999,

00:33:55.580 --> 00:33:58.000
with 15 to 24 year olds
being at higher risk

00:33:58.000 --> 00:33:59.380
than any other age group.

00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:00.840
Now, given these stats

00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:03.850
on how SS is crossing the
line in so many other ways,

00:34:03.850 --> 00:34:06.440
other attempts to halt
its activities are emerging.

00:34:06.700 --> 00:34:08.140
It's not illegal in most places

00:34:08.140 --> 00:34:10.030
to encourage others
to harm themselves.

00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:11.340
That, at present,

00:34:11.340 --> 00:34:13.390
broadly falls within the
boundaries of free speech

00:34:13.390 --> 00:34:14.790
in the U.S. and Europe.

00:34:14.790 --> 00:34:15.780
But in most countries,

00:34:15.780 --> 00:34:18.050
it is illegal to provide
instructions and help.

00:34:18.370 --> 00:34:19.390
So, with that in mind,

00:34:19.390 --> 00:34:21.630
in October 2022, in the U.S.,

00:34:21.630 --> 00:34:23.230
a new bipartisan bill called

00:34:23.230 --> 00:34:25.978
the Stop Online Assisted
S---cide Forums Act

00:34:25.980 --> 00:34:27.970
was introduced to the
House of Representatives

00:34:27.970 --> 00:34:29.850
by congresswoman Lori Trahan.

00:34:30.050 --> 00:34:31.640
LORI: My name is Lori Trahan,

00:34:31.640 --> 00:34:32.870
and I represent

00:34:33.270 --> 00:34:36.170
Massachusetts' 3rd congressional
district in the Congress.

00:34:36.170 --> 00:34:37.520
MARTIN: What motivated you to

00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:38.790
introduce this bill?

00:34:39.140 --> 00:34:42.080
LORI: We know that we're facing a
mental health crisis in our nation.

00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:44.870
S---cide is dangerously on the rise,

00:34:45.270 --> 00:34:46.670
and we need to be meeting

00:34:46.670 --> 00:34:48.820
the mental health needs
of our children.

00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:50.560
Far too many families have

00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:52.550
lost a child or a loved one

00:34:52.550 --> 00:34:54.770
because rather than help individuals,

00:34:54.770 --> 00:34:57.500
they push them towards
self-harm instead.

00:34:57.890 --> 00:34:59.420
MARTIN: The New York
Times', er, report,

00:34:59.420 --> 00:35:01.030
did that play a big part in your-

00:35:01.030 --> 00:35:02.230
in maki- making you-

00:35:02.230 --> 00:35:03.270
making you aware of it?

00:35:03.270 --> 00:35:05.290
LORI: Absolutely! I'll
never forget the morning

00:35:05.290 --> 00:35:07.000
that I listened, er,

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.790
to The Daily, which is the
New York Times' podcast.

00:35:10.070 --> 00:35:11.130
That's what stopped me.

00:35:11.130 --> 00:35:12.610
I was getting ready
for work that morning

00:35:12.610 --> 00:35:13.930
I was in Washington.

00:35:13.930 --> 00:35:15.430
And I just-

00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:18.340
I sat on my bed and I
listened to the whole thing.

00:35:18.340 --> 00:35:19.820
I thought, "How could this be?"

00:35:19.820 --> 00:35:21.510
And I just thought it
was going to be, y'know,

00:35:21.510 --> 00:35:23.490
"Okay, folks don't know
that this is happening."

00:35:23.490 --> 00:35:25.380
"I'm going to write to
the Department of Justice,"

00:35:25.380 --> 00:35:27.650
"and I'm going to say,
'You need to shut this down."

00:35:27.650 --> 00:35:29.630
And then I was reminded that there,

00:35:30.020 --> 00:35:31.100
uh, y'know, this is a

00:35:31.100 --> 00:35:34.050
complex legal territory
that we're in,

00:35:34.050 --> 00:35:35.370
um, so it wasn't

00:35:35.370 --> 00:35:37.520
just so straightforward, um...

00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:38.290
But,

00:35:38.290 --> 00:35:40.450
y'know, in the process
of figuring out

00:35:40.450 --> 00:35:42.140
what our next move was,

00:35:42.140 --> 00:35:43.510
y'know, I talked to many of

00:35:43.510 --> 00:35:45.190
the moms and the families

00:35:45.190 --> 00:35:47.090
who had lost a loved one,

00:35:47.090 --> 00:35:48.450
which only emboldened

00:35:48.450 --> 00:35:50.760
my staff and me to continue the work

00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:52.680
a- and look at a legislative option,

00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:54.660
which is ultimately
what we've introduced

00:35:54.660 --> 00:35:55.900
after 11 months.

00:35:56.300 --> 00:35:57.150
MARTIN: I'm kind of curious.

00:35:57.150 --> 00:35:57.700
Um...

00:35:57.700 --> 00:35:58.930
Y'know, you mentioned
that there's some,

00:35:59.450 --> 00:36:00.210
I guess,

00:36:00.210 --> 00:36:01.320
technicalities that are-

00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:02.700
that are quite awkward to overcome.

00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:03.150
W- How-

00:36:03.150 --> 00:36:04.470
How would the bill work,

00:36:04.470 --> 00:36:05.700
and how can it be effective?

00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:07.940
LORI: It'll finally make it a felony

00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:09.790
for anyone who uses

00:36:09.790 --> 00:36:11.930
communications like online forums

00:36:11.930 --> 00:36:14.100
to assist in another person's attempt

00:36:14.530 --> 00:36:15.810
to die by s---cide.

00:36:16.120 --> 00:36:17.540
Er, and most importantly,

00:36:17.540 --> 00:36:20.700
it gives the Department of
Justice the authority it needs

00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:22.710
to pursue cases against

00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:24.410
s---cide assistance forums.

00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:26.500
People's lives are at risk

00:36:26.500 --> 00:36:28.020
every day that passes

00:36:28.410 --> 00:36:30.350
with these sketchy websites

00:36:30.350 --> 00:36:32.600
that are operating in
a legal gray area,

00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:33.490
and

00:36:33.490 --> 00:36:35.278
er, I'm committed to working

00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:38.630
with representatives Katie Porter,
Mike Carey and Chris Stewart,

00:36:38.630 --> 00:36:39.620
um,

00:36:39.620 --> 00:36:42.270
who I introduced this
legislation with

00:36:42.270 --> 00:36:43.660
er, to get it passed as-

00:36:43.660 --> 00:36:45.120
as soon as possible.

00:36:45.430 --> 00:36:47.360
MARTIN: Because the
site is anonymous,

00:36:47.780 --> 00:36:49.190
and- and also because

00:36:49.190 --> 00:36:50.400
the people who are on the site,

00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:51.760
by the very nature of the topic,

00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:54.230
are very very vulnerable
and we know very very young,

00:36:54.490 --> 00:36:56.500
it just seems like the
perfect breeding ground

00:36:56.500 --> 00:36:57.220
for...

00:36:57.910 --> 00:37:00.160
someone who's not giving
it i- like a- a- advice.

00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:01.560
Someone who's a malicious actor.

00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:03.390
Someone who's there to do bad.

00:37:03.390 --> 00:37:05.950
LORI: I think the unfortunate
reality is that these

00:37:06.350 --> 00:37:08.080
malicious actors, uh,

00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:09.320
they exist in real life

00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:10.510
and online,

00:37:10.510 --> 00:37:12.490
and what the forums

00:37:12.490 --> 00:37:14.590
uniquely do is give
these individuals

00:37:14.590 --> 00:37:17.280
direct access to users
who are in crisis.

00:37:17.730 --> 00:37:19.390
Er, often our young people,

00:37:19.390 --> 00:37:20.880
who are experiencing

00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:23.240
some of the hardest
battles in their lives

00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:24.800
and who desperately need help.

00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:25.370
But...

00:37:25.690 --> 00:37:27.740
But, y'know, rather
than offer assistance

00:37:27.740 --> 00:37:29.550
or direct them toward resources

00:37:29.550 --> 00:37:31.320
to get the care that they need,

00:37:31.700 --> 00:37:33.090
these bad actors

00:37:33.090 --> 00:37:34.410
encourage them

00:37:34.410 --> 00:37:35.580
to harm themselves,

00:37:35.580 --> 00:37:36.780
and then assist them.

00:37:37.140 --> 00:37:39.560
That's the kind of behavior
we need to get rid of,

00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:41.320
and that's the kind of
authority we give,

00:37:41.650 --> 00:37:43.150
uh, the Department of Justice

00:37:43.150 --> 00:37:45.840
to hold these bad actors accountable.

00:37:46.060 --> 00:37:48.450
So this legislation isn't about,

00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:49.770
um,

00:37:49.770 --> 00:37:51.610
trying to shut down forums

00:37:51.610 --> 00:37:53.450
focused on discussing s---cide.

00:37:53.450 --> 00:37:55.220
I mean, there's real value in

00:37:55.220 --> 00:37:56.760
people being able

00:37:56.760 --> 00:37:57.980
to come together

00:37:57.980 --> 00:37:59.440
and share their stories.

00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:01.600
But what's dangerous is when

00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:03.620
people think that
they're logging onto

00:38:03.620 --> 00:38:05.790
a forum that will
be helpful to them,

00:38:05.790 --> 00:38:08.020
but instead find a forum

00:38:08.290 --> 00:38:10.450
focused on pushing them through

00:38:10.450 --> 00:38:12.770
material support to
end their own lives.

00:38:12.770 --> 00:38:14.550
And that's what we need to end.

00:38:14.550 --> 00:38:16.140
MARTIN (narrating):
In 2020, in the U.K.,

00:38:16.140 --> 00:38:17.810
a young man named Joe Nihil

00:38:17.810 --> 00:38:19.480
took his own life aided by the forum.

00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:21.090
In the note he left behind,

00:38:21.090 --> 00:38:22.650
he specifically mentioned the forum

00:38:22.650 --> 00:38:24.570
and his beliefs that it
should be closed down.

00:38:25.050 --> 00:38:26.410
Since then, his mother Catherine

00:38:26.410 --> 00:38:27.830
and sister-in-law Melanie,

00:38:27.830 --> 00:38:29.230
along with Angela Stevens,

00:38:29.230 --> 00:38:31.040
the mother of another
victim in the U.K.,

00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:33.830
have been fighting for
stronger legislation for years.

00:38:33.830 --> 00:38:35.480
CATHERINE: Joe was
on there for 10 days.

00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:38.210
His first post was that he-

00:38:38.210 --> 00:38:39.740
he was feeling really down,

00:38:39.740 --> 00:38:41.070
and told them about

00:38:41.070 --> 00:38:42.500
his past relationship,

00:38:42.500 --> 00:38:43.520
and they said,

00:38:43.520 --> 00:38:45.070
"Oh, it's never going
to get better."

00:38:45.350 --> 00:38:45.870
Um...

00:38:45.870 --> 00:38:47.020
"Yes, your life's"

00:38:47.620 --> 00:38:49.410
"basically not worth living anymore".

00:38:49.970 --> 00:38:51.690
Then they tell you that
"your parents are wrong",

00:38:51.690 --> 00:38:52.770
they tell you that

00:38:52.770 --> 00:38:54.100
"the doctors are wrong",

00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:55.300
"the"

00:38:55.300 --> 00:38:56.960
"mental health team are wrong".

00:38:57.280 --> 00:38:59.320
So once you get to feeling that low,

00:38:59.620 --> 00:39:00.440
that's it.

00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:01.210
"Take your life".

00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:02.560
"Finish it".

00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:05.990
I suffer every day and I know
the rest of my family suffer

00:39:06.310 --> 00:39:07.320
every day.

00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:08.800
And it just destroys you.

00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:10.510
ANGELA: Brett told me that

00:39:10.510 --> 00:39:12.080
he was going on a

00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:13.170
short holiday.

00:39:13.170 --> 00:39:15.400
It- When he didn't return,

00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:15.920
um,

00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:17.660
I reported him missing.

00:39:18.300 --> 00:39:18.990
Um...

00:39:18.990 --> 00:39:19.560
And

00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:21.390
the police told me that

00:39:21.390 --> 00:39:23.180
he'd been found in

00:39:23.180 --> 00:39:23.830
Scotland.

00:39:24.090 --> 00:39:26.890
Police Scotland got in touch with me

00:39:26.890 --> 00:39:28.990
and told me that he'd been on

00:39:28.990 --> 00:39:30.210
a s---cide forum,

00:39:30.210 --> 00:39:32.460
and they actually mentioned the name

00:39:32.460 --> 00:39:34.280
of the- o- of the site.

00:39:34.630 --> 00:39:36.950
And so in the March of 2020,

00:39:36.950 --> 00:39:38.630
we went into lockdown.

00:39:38.630 --> 00:39:39.970
Because we knew

00:39:39.970 --> 00:39:41.820
as a family of this site,

00:39:42.290 --> 00:39:44.080
my youngest daughter,

00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:46.790
who was very very close to Brett,

00:39:47.170 --> 00:39:49.270
she just couldn't come
to terms with his death.

00:39:49.570 --> 00:39:50.890
And she actually went on to

00:39:50.890 --> 00:39:51.870
[NAME OF FORUM CENSORED]

00:39:51.870 --> 00:39:52.800
herself

00:39:53.150 --> 00:39:54.310
and purchased

00:39:54.930 --> 00:39:56.340
[NAME OF METHOD CENSORED]

00:39:58.610 --> 00:39:59.720
MARTIN: To prove that
it could be done?

00:40:00.810 --> 00:40:01.470
ANGELA: No.

00:40:01.730 --> 00:40:02.300
MARTIN: Oh, okay.

00:40:02.300 --> 00:40:03.580
ANGELA: To join her brother.

00:40:05.090 --> 00:40:05.880
MARTIN: And- And- And you-

00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:07.220
And you caught her?

00:40:07.220 --> 00:40:08.780
ANGELA: She told one of her friends

00:40:08.780 --> 00:40:10.600
that she was feeling really low,

00:40:11.050 --> 00:40:11.800
and

00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:14.060
he actually contacted the police

00:40:14.060 --> 00:40:15.590
to do a welfare check.

00:40:16.140 --> 00:40:16.760
And when-

00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:17.760
When the police

00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:19.110
went to my daughter's house,

00:40:19.110 --> 00:40:21.720
she then admitted that
she'd purchased this stuff,

00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:22.710
um...

00:40:22.710 --> 00:40:25.060
and we were all just
an absolute wreck.

00:40:25.060 --> 00:40:25.990
We were a wreck.

00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:27.400
MARTIN (narrating): I should mention,

00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:28.420
just as an aside,

00:40:28.420 --> 00:40:30.400
that because these women
are taking a stand,

00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:32.230
the site admin on SS likes to

00:40:32.230 --> 00:40:34.920
goad them about the death of
their children on social media.

00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:36.520
MARTIN: You sent me some, um...

00:40:36.910 --> 00:40:38.130
examples of...

00:40:38.490 --> 00:40:40.320
I felt, very very abusive

00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:41.890
and incredibly heartless,

00:40:42.330 --> 00:40:44.300
uh, statements that
they've made to you

00:40:44.300 --> 00:40:45.970
just because you've
confronted them as well.

00:40:45.970 --> 00:40:47.210
I- I mean, I don't even know

00:40:47.210 --> 00:40:48.290
if I've seen half of it.

00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:49.380
But, um...

00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:51.100
CATHERINE: No, no.
MELANIE: You've definitely
not seen half of it.

00:40:51.100 --> 00:40:52.430
MELANIE: There's a lot.

00:40:52.430 --> 00:40:54.540
MARTIN (narrating): Anyway,
inspired by Catherine and Melanie,

00:40:54.540 --> 00:40:56.400
their local MP, Richard Burgon,

00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:58.670
presented a motion on
the topic in 2020.

00:40:58.670 --> 00:40:59.930
RICHARD: My name is Richard Burgon,

00:40:59.930 --> 00:41:01.960
I'm the Member of Parliament
for Leeds East.

00:41:02.310 --> 00:41:05.340
Catherine and Melanie have run
a really inspiring campaign

00:41:05.790 --> 00:41:07.320
to try and fulfill

00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:08.530
Joe's wishes,

00:41:08.530 --> 00:41:09.780
to try and ensure

00:41:09.780 --> 00:41:11.960
that people aren't
exposed to that kind of

00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:13.020
dangerous,

00:41:13.020 --> 00:41:14.840
er, online, er, content,

00:41:15.090 --> 00:41:16.950
So th- So that what happened to Joe

00:41:16.950 --> 00:41:18.180
doesn't happen to,

00:41:18.180 --> 00:41:19.540
er, other people.

00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:21.720
MARTIN (narrating): Since then,
after a lot of discussion,

00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:23.740
the present government in
the U.K. has introduced

00:41:23.740 --> 00:41:25.330
the Online Safety bill,

00:41:25.330 --> 00:41:26.550
a broad new legislation

00:41:26.550 --> 00:41:29.060
which is currently working its
way through Parliament right now.

00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:32.330
This is quite a different legislation
to that being introduced in the U.S..

00:41:32.680 --> 00:41:34.060
It's had a rough ride so far

00:41:34.060 --> 00:41:35.160
due to, again,

00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:37.378
concerns about
safeguarding free speech,

00:41:37.380 --> 00:41:40.600
which led to some big changes
in the proposal in 2022.

00:41:40.940 --> 00:41:42.310
The most contentious part,

00:41:42.310 --> 00:41:43.950
which has since been
taken out of the bill,

00:41:43.950 --> 00:41:46.020
requires sites to remove content

00:41:46.020 --> 00:41:47.820
the government deemed to be harmful,

00:41:47.820 --> 00:41:49.790
even though that content
isn't illegal.

00:41:50.020 --> 00:41:52.280
RICHARD: In fact, a lot of us
at the bill, in relation to

00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:54.630
s---cide-related online content,

00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:56.660
were going in the right direction,

00:41:56.960 --> 00:41:58.180
but this new development of the

00:41:58.180 --> 00:42:00.430
'government removing the
legal-but-harmful' clause

00:42:00.430 --> 00:42:02.530
is really a worrying step backwards.

00:42:02.530 --> 00:42:03.650
I have to save the bill.

00:42:03.650 --> 00:42:05.290
MARTIN (narrating):
However, in its place,

00:42:05.290 --> 00:42:07.140
the government included
a new amendment

00:42:07.140 --> 00:42:08.600
that would make it illegal to

00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:10.160
encourage someone else to self-harm.

00:42:10.500 --> 00:42:12.170
And if that gets passed into law,

00:42:12.170 --> 00:42:13.380
that's a very big step.

00:42:13.380 --> 00:42:14.600
MARTIN: I would imagine t- that you-

00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:15.920
You would welcome the,

00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:17.560
uh, criminalization of

00:42:17.560 --> 00:42:19.610
encouragement of, uh, self-harm,

00:42:19.610 --> 00:42:21.470
which I think was introduced
recently, right?

00:42:22.270 --> 00:42:24.090
RICHARD: Yes. So what David Davis,

00:42:24.090 --> 00:42:24.780
the,

00:42:24.780 --> 00:42:26.520
uh, Conservative MP, brought

00:42:26.520 --> 00:42:28.170
a very helpful Amendment

00:42:28.170 --> 00:42:29.350
to the bill,

00:42:29.350 --> 00:42:31.930
uh, which I signed up to,
which I supported,

00:42:32.280 --> 00:42:32.970
uh, which,

00:42:33.370 --> 00:42:34.650
uh, criminalized

00:42:34.650 --> 00:42:37.200
the encouragement of
civilian self-harm.

00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:39.300
Uh, that's amazing. Very important.

00:42:39.750 --> 00:42:41.640
MARTIN (narrating): And just as
I was finalizing this video,

00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:43.010
on the 16th of January,

00:42:43.010 --> 00:42:45.330
a large backbench revolt
in the Tory party

00:42:45.330 --> 00:42:46.870
succeeded in forcing the government

00:42:46.870 --> 00:42:49.440
to add a new provision that
would make social media bosses

00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:50.640
face prison time

00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:52.300
if they failed to protect under 18’s

00:42:52.300 --> 00:42:53.780
from damaging online content.

00:42:54.170 --> 00:42:55.430
The next step involves

00:42:55.430 --> 00:42:57.370
what will probably be
a lengthy passage

00:42:57.370 --> 00:42:58.460
through the House of Lords.

00:42:58.970 --> 00:43:01.310
So this whole story
is nowhere near over.

00:43:01.310 --> 00:43:02.980
There's a lot left to be uncovered,

00:43:02.980 --> 00:43:04.130
a lot left to be resolved,

00:43:04.130 --> 00:43:06.520
and we'll just have to see what
happens over the coming months.

00:43:07.110 --> 00:43:09.470
Now, my focus is on what
happened to Bobby C,

00:43:09.470 --> 00:43:12.050
and to try and use this example
to raise awareness about

00:43:12.050 --> 00:43:13.890
how dangerous and manipulative

00:43:13.890 --> 00:43:15.580
those who run the SS forum are.

00:43:15.870 --> 00:43:17.200
My appeal is simple:

00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:18.480
If you're not on it,

00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:19.670
please never seek it out,

00:43:19.670 --> 00:43:20.890
it'll only do you harm.

00:43:21.150 --> 00:43:22.300
And if you are on it,

00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:23.430
please, please leave.

00:43:23.430 --> 00:43:24.590
The moderators have failed

00:43:24.590 --> 00:43:26.300
everyone who joined
the site in good faith.

00:43:26.600 --> 00:43:28.540
They made the whole thing
publicly available,

00:43:28.540 --> 00:43:30.450
including instructions on
how to end your life.

00:43:30.670 --> 00:43:32.440
They chastised the voices of reason

00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:34.460
while encouraging their
most toxic members.

00:43:34.740 --> 00:43:36.100
The incels who started it

00:43:36.100 --> 00:43:37.800
have ostensibly handed
it over to people

00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:39.420
who are equally as toxic,

00:43:39.420 --> 00:43:40.040
stupid,

00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:40.670
uncaring,

00:43:40.670 --> 00:43:42.000
and unqualified as they were.

00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:44.180
It encourages isolation
from your family,

00:43:44.180 --> 00:43:46.020
and advises against seeking help.

00:43:46.020 --> 00:43:47.500
It has people who are empowered

00:43:47.500 --> 00:43:49.220
to tell you that life is meaningless.

00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:50.840
It is a perfect breeding ground for

00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:52.360
psychos and abusers.

00:43:52.360 --> 00:43:54.350
It actively discourages recovery.

00:43:54.350 --> 00:43:56.160
It has the blood of 4 minors—

00:43:56.160 --> 00:43:57.410
4 that we know about—

00:43:57.410 --> 00:43:58.300
on its hands.

00:43:58.300 --> 00:43:59.360
Now, I should mention that

00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:01.700
there are users on the
forum who are not toxic,

00:44:01.700 --> 00:44:03.200
who are just looking for
a place where they can

00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:04.790
speak freely and feel listened to.

00:44:05.100 --> 00:44:07.450
And the reason they're on
the site is partly due to

00:44:07.450 --> 00:44:09.750
an unhelpful stigma
surrounding this topic.

00:44:09.990 --> 00:44:11.510
People are very often ashamed to

00:44:11.510 --> 00:44:14.280
discuss feelings of wanting to
end their own lives openly,

00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:16.660
which is a poor reflection
on society as a whole.

00:44:17.020 --> 00:44:18.250
Let's name one stigma

00:44:18.250 --> 00:44:20.150
mentioned by Professor
Rory O’Connor:

00:44:20.150 --> 00:44:22.210
it's way too commonly
to write it as a

00:44:22.210 --> 00:44:23.140
"selfish act",

00:44:23.500 --> 00:44:26.420
which in turn makes it far less
likely that people will bring it up

00:44:26.420 --> 00:44:28.380
for fear of being
chastised or shunned.

00:44:28.790 --> 00:44:29.850
Instead, he suggests,

00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:31.930
the act is way more
likely to be carried out

00:44:31.930 --> 00:44:33.390
in a moment of desperation

00:44:33.390 --> 00:44:34.570
by those in crisis,

00:44:34.570 --> 00:44:37.050
who could no longer withstand
severe mental pain,

00:44:37.050 --> 00:44:39.770
and who are unable to see
beyond that pain at that moment.

00:44:40.130 --> 00:44:41.570
For those feeling hopeless,

00:44:41.570 --> 00:44:42.850
you should speak to a few people

00:44:42.850 --> 00:44:44.400
before making any other plans.

00:44:44.850 --> 00:44:46.320
Those who say otherwise are probably

00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:47.890
not acting in your real interest.

00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:50.450
Now, I've put a couple of links
in the description below,

00:44:50.450 --> 00:44:53.350
but there may very easily be
local options you can access with

00:44:53.350 --> 00:44:55.240
a quick search engine
check, for example.

00:44:55.660 --> 00:44:56.590
And also, remember

00:44:56.590 --> 00:44:58.570
that if for some reason
you don't connect

00:44:58.570 --> 00:45:00.160
with one mental health specialist,

00:45:00.160 --> 00:45:02.250
this doesn't mean that
seeking help is pointless.

00:45:02.500 --> 00:45:04.660
If one person doesn't
succeed in helping you,

00:45:04.660 --> 00:45:06.050
someone else most likely can.

00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:08.020
And please don't go alone.

00:45:08.020 --> 00:45:09.490
Recovery is possible.

00:45:09.490 --> 00:45:10.560
Things can get better,

00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:12.850
and there are people in the world
who do want the best for you.

00:45:13.130 --> 00:45:14.720
And if you're feeling
like you're in crisis,

00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:16.350
there are experts who
can at least provide you

00:45:16.350 --> 00:45:17.900
with a better sense of your options.

00:45:18.310 --> 00:45:20.060
Nothing bad will come
from speaking to them.

00:45:20.290 --> 00:45:21.970
Again, see the links
in the description.

00:45:22.230 --> 00:45:23.620
And to everyone else watching,

00:45:23.620 --> 00:45:24.880
I have a final thought.

00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:26.790
There really should be
no reason a person has to

00:45:26.790 --> 00:45:29.080
seek out an anonymous forum
to find comfort.

00:45:29.500 --> 00:45:31.870
There are things we can all
do directly to combat this,

00:45:31.870 --> 00:45:33.980
by applying small
protocols of our own.

00:45:34.360 --> 00:45:36.210
Do we know people we
suspect are in pain?

00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:38.210
Can we just give them a
call and listen to them?

00:45:38.590 --> 00:45:39.840
Are there ways we can make the world

00:45:39.840 --> 00:45:41.780
a little nicer for them
and for others?

00:45:42.120 --> 00:45:43.410
And can we be a little
less aggressive

00:45:43.410 --> 00:45:46.030
when others do or say
things we find irritating?

00:45:46.330 --> 00:45:47.980
Can we just cut people's
slack sometimes?

00:45:47.980 --> 00:45:49.150
Because you never know,

00:45:49.150 --> 00:45:50.660
they could be having a
tough time right now

00:45:50.660 --> 00:45:52.270
due to problems that we can't see.

00:45:52.680 --> 00:45:54.400
This is the harder road
to take for sure,

00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:56.240
but it's also highly rewarding too.

00:45:56.240 --> 00:45:59.320
A report from the International
Association for S---cide Prevention

00:45:59.320 --> 00:46:00.160
put it best:

00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:02.640
"Every step closer can
connect someone to life"

00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:03.850
"and the help they want."

00:46:04.300 --> 00:46:05.810
"Sometimes those steps are big,"

00:46:06.250 --> 00:46:07.000
"but sometimes"

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:08.460
"all it takes is a smile."

00:46:09.120 --> 00:46:10.290
That's everything I have to say.

00:46:10.670 --> 00:46:11.570
Thanks very much.

NOTE Paragraph

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.480
In Rome, in the year 1590,

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:06.750
the Italian priest, Lorenzo Busnardo,

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.250
a well known chess master,

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:09.880
faced off against an opponent

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.980
whose name is now lost to time.

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.340
Now, not only is this game a lot of fun,

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.880
it’s also one of the earliest
chess games ever recorded

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.190
using modern rules

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:20.700
and therefore, a fantastic
factual document.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.620
Let me take a few seconds to show you

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:24.200
why this game is so great.

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:25.840
Busnardo, playing white,

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.830
opens with king pawn to E4.

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.310
Black responds king pawn to E5.

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:32.230
White develops the knight to F3.

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:34.280
Black plays knight to C6.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.090
White then plays bishop C4.

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.370
A sequence we now call the Italian game,

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.680
which is the fastest way to
open up these two squares,

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.850
allowing the King to castle safely
on the right-hand side of the board.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:45.930
Black responds with bishop C5

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.870
Next follows C3,

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:49.820
which blocks the knight from moving to B4

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.560
while also preparing for
a pawn attack on D4.

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.980
And now for the first
notable move of the game,

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.220
queen to E7.

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.030
It seems Black is thinking too much about

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.360
the battle that’s going to take place
in the centre of the board

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.810
and not enough on getting
the king safely castled.

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:04.950
A better move would have been Pawn to D6

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:06.840
(which allows for the
development of the bishop)

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.460
or Knight F6.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.700
For his part, Busnardo now castles,

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.560
keeping his king safely tucked away here.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.080
Black’s next move is pawn D6.

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.000
Now, with a small tempo advantage,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.410
white begins the attack,

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:19.970
bringing the pawn to D4,

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:21.380
threatening to capture the bishop.

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.620
Black wisely moves the bishop back to B6

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.130
to maintain control over
this important diagonal,

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.000
but by being forced to move the
same piece twice in the opening,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.250
he's lost the opportunity to bring
this knight or bishop out into the fray,

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.800
which leaves the King still exposed
in the centre of the board

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.080
for yet another move.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.120
White now develops his bishop to G5,

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.640
attacking the queen who
can’t attack back because

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.500
the bishop is defended
by this knight.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.090
And for anyone who might not know,

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.210
a queen for a bishop is a terrible trade.

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.650
Instead, Black decides
to counter-attack with

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:49.920
pawn to F6.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:50.830
Not a good move,

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:52.850
because it’s opening up
this white diagonal

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.610
and blocking this knight from developing.

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:56.870
A much better move
would have been knight F6,

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:59.060
which also opens up the king for castling.

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.530
But at least pawn F6 forces this bishop

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.150
to have to retreat to H4.

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:04.740
Now, Black’s next move is

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.450
not to bring out his remaining forces

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.400
or safeguard the king, as you’d expect.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.700
Instead, it’s a super aggressive move:

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:11.970
pawn to G5.

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.370
A fatal mistake.

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.200
So, rather than moving the bishop
back to G3 as Black expects,

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.530
Busnardo instead plays

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.270
knight captures pawn on G5!

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:23.230
A sacrifice that sets
the slaughter in motion

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:24.850
by opening up this diagonal.

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:26.850
So, Black captures the knight on G5.

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.470
And then White moves the queen to H5.

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.040
Check! And now we can see

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.870
why extending that pawn
earlier was such a bad idea.

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.260
Because if it had been back here,

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.480
it could have defended the
white square from this attack.

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.350
So, the king moves out of the way to D7.

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.820
White’s bishop picks off
the stranded pawn on G5

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:44.210
and is now attacking the queen.

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:46.320
Now, rather than bring
out the knight to F6,

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:47.780
which would block the imminent threat

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.670
while simultaneously posing
a threat to the White queen,

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.450
Black moves the queen to G7

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:53.810
which is a mistake so bad

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.380
that there is now an
unavoidable path to checkmate.

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:57.450
For chess fans out there,

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.520
you can pause the video
now to figure it out.

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.710
If not, then let’s bring on the next move:

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:03.140
bishop to E6.

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.600
To which the only possible answer is

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.710
for the king to capture the bishop on E6.

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.210
The White queen now moves to E8.

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:11.270
Check again!

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:13.550
Black moves the knight to block on E7

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:15.660
And then, the final nail in the coffin.

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.300
A sneaky little pawn attack on D5.

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:19.050
Checkmate!

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:21.280
[struggling noises]

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.050
Ah, man,

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:23.800
pawn checkmate is so brutal.

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.530
And I love the way this bishop and knight
have been sitting here the whole time.

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:27.540
"Uh, what?"

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:28.780
"There was a- There was a what?"

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.440
"The- The war is over already?"

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:35.970
[theme from <i>Curb Your Enthusiasm</i> plays]

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.650
Now, why am I showing this?

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.140
Well, if you look over here,

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.010
you’ll see what’s called 'chess notation',

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.560
a sequence of letters and numbers
that were recorded in 1590.

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.360
This allows us to witness,

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.430
with none of the distortion that normally
affects our perception of history,

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:50.880
how a celebrated player

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.590
schooled a less experienced player,

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.970
pulling off a really fun
little punchline at the end.

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:56.920
But the notation you see here is not

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.140
what would have been used to
record this match at the time.

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.090
Back then, the moves
would have been recorded

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:02.830
in a much more descriptive fashion.

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:04.570
For example, if we look at move 7,

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:06.530
they would have used
a long description, like:

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:07.050
"7:"

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:09.950
"White moves its undeveloped
bishop to the king knight’s file"

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:11.430
"so that it’s attacking the queen"

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:12.270
Well, actually,

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:14.270
the moves were even more
descriptive than that,

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:17.240
to what many today would
consider a ludicrous degree.

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:18.700
For example, in Arthur Saul’s

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:20.850
seminal 1619 publication

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:22.560
<i>​​The famous game of chesse-play

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:23.600

[struggles to pronounce]
<i>​​soeuer.

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:37.540
Er... He, um,

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:39.120
he gives the following description:

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.300
"Then the black King
for his second draught"

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:42.480
"brings forth his Queen,"

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.240
"and placeth her in the third house,"

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.440
"in the front of his Bishops pawne."

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:48.650
This type of elaborate description was

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:50.550
awkward for pamphlets or newspapers

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.200
who wanted to report on a game,

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.550
since printed space was
a precious commodity.

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.220
So more concise systems began to emerge.

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:59.600
One system was to
number each of the squares,

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.100
starting at the bottom-right corner

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:02.760
and counting from right to left,

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.870
so that every square could
be uniquely described.

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:06.500
The only problem was disagreement on

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:08.390
which direction the numbers should go.

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:10.770
In this clip originally from
the Philadelphia Gazette,

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:14.470
they describe how the numbering
should start from Black’s king castle

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:15.670
descending down the rank,

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:17.560
and beginning again on the next file.

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.410
But it wasn’t just the names of the
squares that people disagreed on.

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:23.320
There was also the matter of how
to describe names of the pieces.

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:25.340
Should the knight be
represented with the letter 'K'

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:26.920
or should the king get it instead?

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:28.500
Should it be 'C' for castle or

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:29.520
'R' for rook?

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.030
Well, ultimately it doesn’t matter

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:33.420
because every language had
their own system of lettering.

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:34.710
So, to get around these problems,

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:37.070
attempts at universal standards were made.

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:38.280
In 1855,

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.980
Q. Poirson-Prugneaux
proposed such a system

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:42.290
which also sought to reflect

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:44.970
the symmetry of the game
from each player’s perspective.

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:47.160
The files were named
after their starting pieces.

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.430
'T' for rooks (a.k.a. castles),

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:50.250
'C' for knights,

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:51.260
'F' for bishops,

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:52.170
'D' for queens

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:53.590
and 'R' for kings.

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:54.680
Black’s side was numbered

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:56.320
1, 2, 3, 4 towards the centre

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:57.380
and on White’s side,

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:59.190
1, 2, 3, 4 towards the centre.

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:00.630
These apostrophes were used

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:02.670
to identify the opponent’s
side of the board,

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:04.050
so if white is moving,

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:05.420
the apostrophes are here.

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:06.470
If black is moving,

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:07.400
they’re here.

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:09.080
And since there’s a lot of duplication,

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:10.970
like this square is called 4F

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:13.120
but this square is also called 4F,

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:14.760
those on the king’s side of the board

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:17.100
had a little double dot placed above them,

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:19.250
which means each square
has a unique marking.

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:20.800
Honestly, this one just sucks

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.750
and unsurprisingly, it didn’t take.

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:24.770
'Compass notation'
was a bit more intuitive

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:27.750
because it used directional
instructions we’re all familiar with.

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:28.530
For example,

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:30.770
QBSW5 would mean:

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:33.390
queen’s bishop moves 5 spaces south west.

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:34.160
Hmm...

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:35.470
Okay, that is easy to understand,

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:36.650
but it doesn’t work for knights

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:37.990
because they move weird,

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:38.870
dum-dum-dum,

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:39.810
dum-dum-dum,

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:40.740
et cetera.

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:42.930
So there had to be a
special numbered notation

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:44.580
created specifically for knights

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:47.690
that could describe all the
potential moves in any given turn.

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:49.810
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:50.770
Uh...

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:52.040
That kind of ruins it.

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:53.400
This didn’t catch on either.

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.710
So eventually, we landed
on what’s now called

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:57.040
'descriptive notation',

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:58.830
which was the standard for quite a while.

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:01.100
The files are named
after the starting pieces:

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:02.790
queen rook, queen knight, queen bishop;

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:04.530
king rook, king knight, king bishop.

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:05.500
With this system,

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:06.950
squares had 2 different names:

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:08.900
which described either
player’s perspective.

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:09.960
From White’s point of view,

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:11.630
this is K1, because

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:12.230
1.

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:13.140
From black’s point of view,

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:14.580
it’s K8 because

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:16.310
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:18.180
So, an opening might start

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:18.800
1.

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:19.470
P-K4,

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:20.600
P-K4.

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:21.820
Not terribly hard to read

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:23.630
but a little clunky for sure.

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:26.450
Anyway, descriptive notation
was finally superseded

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:28.310
by the current modern standard,

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:29.500
'algebraic notation',

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:32.000
which has nothing to do with algebra
in case you were wondering.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.350
It was initially proposed
by Philipp Stamma in his

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:36.690
<i>Essai sur le jeu des echecs.

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:39.790
This did away with the idea of needing
to represent the player’s perspective

00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:41.880
and stuck to a simple labelling system.

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:43.340
A to H for the files.

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:44.750
1 to 8 for the ranks.

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:45.880
Like descriptive notation,

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:47.940
it used 'R' for rook, 'N' for knight,

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:50.400
'B' for bishop, 'Q' for queen,
and 'K' for king.

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:52.630
Pawns didn’t get a letter
because they’re crap.

00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:54.450
So, a simple opening might start:

00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:56.260
1. E4, E5.

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.320
2. Nf3, NC6

00:07:58.320 --> 00:07:59.380
and so on.

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:01.370
Now, what’s interesting
about Stamma’s essay

00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:02.860
is that it’s really old,

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:04.660
published in 1737,

00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:06.530
which means that algebraic notation was

00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:09.000
battling it out for centuries
with all the other systems,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.120
gradually winning people over
until it finally became the standard,

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:15.130
officially recognised by the
International Chess Federation,

00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:17.790
who dropped descriptive notation in 1981.

00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:21.130
Algebraic notation doesn’t come
out on top in every single criteria,

00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:23.490
but it does the best
overall job and therefore

00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:25.300
won the chess notation war.

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:27.500
I wouldn’t quite call it the
least bad option because

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:29.180
it’s just so clear and simple.

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:31.620
That of course didn’t prevent
bucket loads of whinging

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:33.310
from various small factions,

00:08:33.310 --> 00:08:35.890
who strongly advocated
for their preferred system

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:38.680
due to some specific
advantage it had in one area,

00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:40.640
despite its shortcomings in most others.

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:43.390
And there have been similar
wars in plenty of other fields too.

00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:46.280
I mean, there are competing
systems of dentistry notation.

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:49.090
That’s right, we couldn’t even
agree on how we label our teeth.

00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:50.060
Uh, als- also…

00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:50.870
[sigh]

00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:52.080
to whoever drew this.

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:53.240
Just, uh, thank you.

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:54.740
Thank you so much for this.

00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:56.230
Uh... I don't know what to say.

00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:57.610
[chuckles] Alright, anyway.

00:08:57.610 --> 00:09:00.090
Now, the arguments about
which standard is best in chess

00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:01.550
will never be over.

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:04.040
There’ll always be those who
question the status quo.

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:05.750
For example, on Chess.com,

00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:06.860
under a thread titled

00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:09.120
‘I wonder why algebraic notation?’

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:10.250
the OP asks:

00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:11.910
"Why not descriptive notation?"

00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:14.040
"That means moves like P-K4."

00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:17.230
"Why does U.S. chess endorse
algebraic notation instead?"

00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:18.410
"Oh, that’s easy."

00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:20.590
"It’s because descriptive notation sucks."

00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:22.310
"Algebraic notation sucks."

00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:24.070
"Descriptive notation sucks."

00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:25.980
"Numeric notation rules!"

00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:28.240
You see these kinds of
discussions all the time.

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:29.240
Constant arguing.

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:30.220
Endless division.

00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:30.900
Hyperbole.

00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:31.750
Dismissiveness.

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:33.670
It just goes on and on.

00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:35.930
There will never be universal agreement.

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:38.740
Now, we over here in the music world,

00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:39.780
we look at all of this,

00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:41.420
how we see things quite differently.

00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:43.610
What we see here is not a massive mess,

00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:44.140
no…

00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:46.060
because compared to what we’re used to,

00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:48.250
this is a GODDAMN UTOPIA!

00:09:48.250 --> 00:10:24.000
🎵

00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:37.230
Standard western notation
is criticised all the time,

00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:38.640
and has been for centuries.

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:42.080
And because it’s so widespread across
musical genres and disciplines,

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:44.170
there are many different
types of criticism.

00:10:44.170 --> 00:10:46.340
But I think I can boil them
all down to one statement,

00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:47.300
which is that

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:50.530
notation makes it unnecessarily
hard to read music.

00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:52.640
For those who feel strongly about this,

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:56.190
there is a belief that notation lost its way
somewhere during its evolution

00:10:56.190 --> 00:10:59.460
and that it has failed to keep up with
the demands of musicians today.

00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:00.280
Worse still,

00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:01.410
it’s entrenched;

00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:03.930
shored up by a minority
of out-of-touch zealots

00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:05.780
who throttle all attempts at reform,

00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:08.060
so that a superior system
can never take over.

00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:10.340
And consequently, if we
want to read music today

00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:12.400
for the purpose of
practising our instruments

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:14.110
or learning pieces by heart

00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:15.360
or studying music theory

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:17.400
or sight reading during a performance,

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:19.410
we’re forced to do it the hard way.

00:11:19.410 --> 00:11:21.930
This criticism usually sends
people into a frenzy of

00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:23.970
fervent agreement or disagreement.

00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:26.540
An argument that has
lasted for almost a millenia.

00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:28.920
But buried deep in all of
these volatile discussions

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:31.470
is a wealth of interesting
ideas and anecdotes,

00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:34.450
so much more than I’d realised before
I began researching this topic.

00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:37.090
So, in this video, we’re going
to be looking at notation.

00:11:37.090 --> 00:11:38.440
How it came to be this way.

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:39.460
where it’s strong;

00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:40.410
where it’s weak,

00:11:40.410 --> 00:11:41.260
and how it compares

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.800
to the numerous attempts that
have been made to replace it.

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:45.590
Attempts that range from the good,

00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:46.700
to the okay,

00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:47.880
to the appalling,

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:49.030
to the hilarious.

00:11:49.290 --> 00:11:51.220
And regardless of where
you stand on this topic—

00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:52.550
hot, cold or indifferent—

00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:55.160
the one thing I can promise you
throughout the course of this video

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:57.580
is that you’ll be surprised
a number of times.

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:01.180
"For me, it's not logical."

00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:04.970
Okay, so the first thing to acknowledge
about standard Western notation

00:12:04.970 --> 00:12:06.880
is that it is, at its heart,

00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:08.440
a multi-layered compromise.

00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:10.510
A system that evolved over nine centuries

00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:13.980
to meet ever new musical demands
and technological advancements.

00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:16.130
A highly calibrated balance of harms.

00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:17.780
And just to give a quick example:

00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:19.340
right at the heart of notation,

00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:20.340
there’s a tension

00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:21.930
between harmonic legibility

00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:23.220
and rhythmic legibility.

00:12:23.490 --> 00:12:26.510
Rhythm is easier to read when
horizontal space is uniform.

00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:28.690
Dum, Dum, Dum, Dum,

00:12:28.690 --> 00:12:30.680
Dumdum, Dumdum, Dumdum, Dumdum,

00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:32.880
Dadadada, Dadadada, Dadadada, Dadadada.

00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:36.050
However, if you now introduce
a variety of notes and chords,

00:12:36.050 --> 00:12:38.120
the need for extra space
to read them clearly,

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:40.080
including these sharp and flat symbols,

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:42.670
necessarily breaks horizontal uniformity.

00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:44.620
Worse still if you do something like this.

00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:47.020
Now, bar 3 is twice as wide as bar 1,

00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:49.510
even though they both last
the same length of time.

00:12:49.710 --> 00:12:50.670
Now, logically,

00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:54.030
you’d imagine that the answer is to
space everything out to be uniform,

00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:57.610
but that then means that loads of space
is being taken up unnecessarily,

00:12:57.610 --> 00:13:00.790
so less overall music can
fit on the page or screen,

00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:02.270
which is awkward for performers

00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:04.180
who now have to do more page turns.

00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:06.920
And this push and pull between
different musical criteria

00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:10.290
is emblematic of the balance that
musical notation needs to strike

00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:12.220
except it needs to strike this balance

00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:13.900
in about a hundred different ways.

00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:16.230
As I said, it’s a
multi-layered compromise,

00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:19.810
which means that when you view
one aspect of notation in isolation,

00:13:19.810 --> 00:13:21.510
you will find imperfections.

00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:24.120
And this is what gives
endless fuel to critics

00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:25.910
who advocate for outright replacement.

00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:27.270
"For me, it's not logical."

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:29.860
Now, these critics can be
split into a few camps.

00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:31.560
I’m going to name the first camp

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:32.680
'The Reformers':

00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:35.600
a small group of highly informed
and imaginative people

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:38.280
who have proposed alternative
notation systems of their own,

00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:41.100
some which challenge Western
notation in really compelling ways,

00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:42.260
as we’ll see later.

00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:44.860
Next are 'The C- Reformers':

00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:47.790
a much larger group of
reasonably informed musicians

00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:50.180
who exhibit a deep knowledge in one area

00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:52.350
but who are blind to many others.

00:13:52.350 --> 00:13:53.060
Then there are

00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:54.560
'The Disruptors':

00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:56.670
a group of highly uninformed people,

00:13:56.670 --> 00:13:58.840
often with expertise in a different field

00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:00.230
(usually technology)

00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:02.250
who mistake their ignorance for a kind of

00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:03.490
fresh-eyed clarity,

00:14:03.490 --> 00:14:06.030
misrecognizing the gaps
in their understanding as

00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:07.830
actual gaps in notation itself.

00:14:07.830 --> 00:14:09.320
Things musicians just...

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:11.590
forgot to address
because they’re so silly.

00:14:11.590 --> 00:14:14.710
The disrupters can see that the
emperor isn’t wearing any clothes

00:14:14.710 --> 00:14:16.510
and they’re going to
make themselves heard,

00:14:16.510 --> 00:14:18.430
loudly denouncing music notation as

00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:20.330
hopelessly stupid and inefficient.

00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:22.290
It brings to mind the age-old saying:

00:14:22.290 --> 00:14:24.010
The less you know about a subject,

00:14:24.010 --> 00:14:25.910
the more you’ll bitch and moan about it,

00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:27.410
like a petulant brat.

00:14:27.410 --> 00:14:28.300
To give an example,

00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:31.130
let’s look at a tweet by the
founder of Epic Games,

00:14:31.130 --> 00:14:32.020
Tim Sweeny:

00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:34.540
"Music notation is silly and inefficient."

00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:37.100
"Much better if everyone
moved to piano roll notation."

00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:38.940
"It’s symmetric across octaves"

00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:40.910
"and much more visually intuitive."

00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:44.170
Now, as eager as I am to be schooled
by a video game developer

00:14:44.170 --> 00:14:46.000
on the productive use of my time,

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.100
Tim has not really made the most
convincing argument here.

00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:50.560
But in order to show why,

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:52.300
we need to take a step back—

00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:53.990
way back, baby—

00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:56.390
to look at how musical notation
came to be this way,

00:14:56.390 --> 00:14:58.520
so we can catalogue
its long list of crimes,

00:14:58.520 --> 00:14:59.700
and also give ourselves

00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:01.260
a proper historical context,

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:03.820
which will help us have more fun
when assessing the suggestions

00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:05.520
of those who would see it replaced.

00:15:05.830 --> 00:15:07.960
This will also give those
who can’t read notation

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:09.990
a quick tutorial on how it works too.

00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:16.840
The Belgian musicologist

00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:19.080
François-Auguste Gevaert suggests that

00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:21.150
of all the various systems
of music notation

00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:22.790
that have existed throughout history,

00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:25.100
there are two fundamentally
different types:

00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:26.010
the first is

00:15:26.010 --> 00:15:27.150
'phonetic notation',

00:15:27.150 --> 00:15:30.260
where sounds are represented by
letters, numbers or words.

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:32.460
We can see this in traditional Chinese,

00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:33.240
Arabic and

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:34.260
Indian notation

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:36.120
as well as ancient Greek notation.

00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:37.990
We can also see it in
more modern examples,

00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:39.660
like the Tonic sol-fa system

00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:41.660
and Chinese system Jianpu.

00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:43.930
Let’s zoom in on ancient
Greece for a moment

00:15:43.930 --> 00:15:46.580
to give you a feel for how
unique this system was.

00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:48.820
Here’s an example of a
fragment of ancient music

00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:50.360
where you can see
the words of a poem,

00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:53.330
with precise musical pitches
described in lettering above them.

00:15:53.780 --> 00:15:55.640
There were actually
two lettering systems.

00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:56.690
One for voice and

00:15:56.690 --> 00:15:58.110
one for instrumentalists.

00:15:58.620 --> 00:16:01.900
It’s important to know a little bit about
how the Greeks thought about music

00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:05.180
because it helps us understand why
their notation system was so simple.

00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:07.900
First, melody was
everything to the Greeks.

00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:08.550
Harmony,

00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:10.390
what Aristotle called ‘mixis’,

00:16:10.390 --> 00:16:13.210
was often really simple compared
to what we’re used to today,

00:16:13.210 --> 00:16:15.500
chosen carefully so that
it didn’t overly influence

00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:17.420
the colour or character of the melody.

00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:19.880
For example, listen to this
fragment of a melody:

00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:30.570
🎵

00:16:30.950 --> 00:16:32.900
Now listen to this accompanying harmony,

00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:34.410
and observe how simple it is

00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:36.440
and how it doesn't
compete with the melody:

00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:47.090
🎵

00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:51.220
If we were to apply a modern harmonic
accompaniment to that melody,

00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:53.020
it might sound a bit more like this:

00:16:53.020 --> 00:17:03.530
🎵

00:17:03.530 --> 00:17:05.290
That would be alien to the Greeks.

00:17:05.290 --> 00:17:07.040
Harmony was subject to strict rules

00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:10.000
and only certain pairings of notes
were considered acceptable.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.330
It was taken so seriously

00:17:11.330 --> 00:17:12.600
that in Plato’s <i>Republic</i>,

00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:15.860
he advised young students to keep away
from accompaniment altogether.

00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:18.240
They should just sing the
same notes they are playing

00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:21.040
because anything more detailed
than that could corrupt their character

00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:22.890
or the character of their listeners.

00:17:22.890 --> 00:17:25.980
Proper accompaniment was only
to be attempted by professionals.

00:17:26.410 --> 00:17:27.480
With vocal music,

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:30.300
rhythm was based on how
words and syllables were spoken.

00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:32.170
However, for instrumental music,

00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:33.450
they couldn’t rely on this system

00:17:33.450 --> 00:17:36.510
so created symbols to
reflect duration instead.

00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:38.910
A regular unit of time
was called a ‘short’,

00:17:38.910 --> 00:17:40.890
which is what we’d call an 8th note.

00:17:40.890 --> 00:17:42.110
Since it was the default,

00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:43.250
it didn’t need a symbol,

00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:44.710
which was great when you knew that rule

00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:46.820
but caused quite a
headache for later historians

00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:48.800
trying to decipher how this system worked.

00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:50.170
Anyway, apart from the short,

00:17:50.170 --> 00:17:52.830
you had the 'long' which
was 2 shorts in duration.

00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:54.110
Then the 3 time long,

00:17:54.110 --> 00:17:55.150
then the 4 time long,

00:17:55.150 --> 00:17:56.120
et cetera.

00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:58.670
Remember this point because it’s
going to come back several times.

00:17:59.310 --> 00:18:00.940
Today, we conceptualise scales

00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:02.480
as a division of the octave,

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:04.110
However, the Greeks did not.

00:18:04.110 --> 00:18:06.830
They considered the fundamental
unit of pitch organisation

00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:08.130
to be the 'tetrachord',

00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:11.460
which is a series of 4 ascending
notes spanning a perfect 4th.

00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:13.390
The first note of the first tetrachord

00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:14.670
was called the 'hypate',

00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:16.470
which translates to ‘the highest’.

00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:18.180
The next note in the
tetrachord was called

00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:19.180
the 'parhypate',

00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:21.190
which means 'the next highest', and so on.

00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:22.890
This can be super confusing for us

00:18:22.890 --> 00:18:25.890
because we use words
like ‘high’ and ‘above’ today

00:18:25.890 --> 00:18:27.150
to refer to pitch.

00:18:27.150 --> 00:18:29.640
This note is ‘above’ this note, etc.

00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:32.330
But the Hypate was actually
the lowest pitch in a tetrachord.

00:18:32.330 --> 00:18:33.720
So when they say ‘highest’,

00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:35.460
what they actually mean is closer to

00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:36.390
‘tallest’:

00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:38.570
specifically, it is referring
to the string on the lyre

00:18:38.570 --> 00:18:39.830
the hypate was played on,

00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:41.590
which was longer than all the others.

00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:43.560
The ancient Greeks did
not conceptualise pitch

00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:45.390
as something that could
be 'higher' or 'lower',

00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:47.410
so the idea of
representing pitch vertically

00:18:47.410 --> 00:18:48.770
would have made no sense to them.

00:18:48.770 --> 00:18:51.790
I’m not going to dig into ancient
Greek music any further than this,

00:18:51.790 --> 00:18:53.770
since ancient sources are both rare

00:18:53.770 --> 00:18:55.010
and also contradictory.

00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:56.930
It seems that, just like today,

00:18:56.930 --> 00:18:58.490
everyone had a different opinion.

00:18:58.910 --> 00:19:00.660
So let’s zoom back out and focus on

00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:03.720
the other fundamental type
of notation defined by Gevaert:

00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:05.210
'diastematic notation',

00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:07.360
where the upward or
downward movement of pitch

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:09.930
is represented vertically
using abstract symbols.

00:19:09.930 --> 00:19:10.640
For example,

00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:11.370
Abyssinian,

00:19:11.370 --> 00:19:12.300
Byzantine,

00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:13.070
Armenian

00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:14.610
and Jewish liturgical notation

00:19:14.610 --> 00:19:17.290
as well as the neume system
seen in Gregorian chant,

00:19:17.290 --> 00:19:18.140
and of course,

00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:19.590
the system we use today.

00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:20.700
The word 'diastema'

00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:22.620
comes from the Greek
word meaning ‘interval’,

00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:24.590
which is incidentally a word also used

00:19:24.590 --> 00:19:26.310
to describe the gap between your teeth.

00:19:27.950 --> 00:19:30.750
Now, what better way to
understand diastematic notation

00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:33.050
than by looking at how
the system we use today

00:19:33.050 --> 00:19:34.190
came into existence?

00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:36.090
So, grab your popcorn, folks,

00:19:36.090 --> 00:19:38.080
because we’ve now reached
the part of the video

00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:40.410
where I do the history
of Western notation.

00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:48.970
The ancient Greek notation
we just looked at

00:19:48.970 --> 00:19:50.770
had persisted under the Roman Empire

00:19:50.770 --> 00:19:52.410
until the 4th century.

00:19:52.410 --> 00:19:54.430
Greek culture was having a hard time.

00:19:54.430 --> 00:19:57.230
The Christian church rejected
many aspects of Greek music,

00:19:57.230 --> 00:19:59.470
including the use of the lyre and flute,

00:19:59.470 --> 00:20:01.850
because they were associated
with pagan worship.

00:20:01.850 --> 00:20:03.720
The final blow to Greek music came

00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:05.260
when the emperor Theodosius,

00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:06.430
an ardent Christian,

00:20:06.430 --> 00:20:08.520
closed all remaining pagan schools.

00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:11.550
Any Greek notation that was still
being taught at the time stopped,

00:20:11.550 --> 00:20:13.730
and ancient Greek music died out entirely.

00:20:13.730 --> 00:20:14.680
And for a time,

00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:17.620
there was no musical notation
in the western Christian world.

00:20:17.620 --> 00:20:20.580
Liturgical music known
as plainchant or plainsong,

00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:22.160
was passed down by ear.

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:25.060
There is one legend of a
notated book of sacred music

00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:27.110
which was collected by Gregory the Great,

00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:29.400
pope between 590 and 604.

00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:30.980
It was called The Antiphonary,

00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:34.240
which was supposedly chained to
the altar at St. Peter’s Cathedral.

00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:36.610
So even if it did exist,
which is unlikely,

00:20:36.610 --> 00:20:37.900
no one had access to it.

00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:40.280
Incidentally, Gregory is the
person being referred to

00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:42.500
when we talk about Gregorian chant.

00:20:42.890 --> 00:20:44.670
Anyway, throughout the Christian world,

00:20:44.670 --> 00:20:46.530
a large problem was beginning to emerge.

00:20:46.530 --> 00:20:48.210
A total lack of consistency in

00:20:48.210 --> 00:20:50.960
how plainchant was
performed from region to region.

00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:52.840
This came to a head in the 9th century,

00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:55.820
when a dispute emerged between
the Frankish and Roman churches,

00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:58.560
documented by the Aquitanian
monk and musicologist,

00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:00.110
Adémar de Chabannes:

00:21:00.110 --> 00:21:03.510
"Behold, a dispute arose
during the feast days of Easter"

00:21:03.510 --> 00:21:05.890
"among the cantors of
the Romans and the Gauls."

00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:09.190
"The Gauls said that they sang better
and more beautifully than the Romans,"

00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:12.590
"and the Romans claimed that they
performed the ecclesiastical songs"

00:21:12.590 --> 00:21:14.040
"in a most learned way,"

00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:16.520
"just as they had been taught
by Saint Gregory the pope,"

00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:18.380
"and that the Gauls sang corruptly"

00:21:18.380 --> 00:21:21.470
"and lacerated the correct
song by destroying it."

00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:23.970
According to the modern
musicologist James Grier,

00:21:23.970 --> 00:21:26.680
this dispute was eventually
resolved in favour of the Romans

00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:28.220
by the emperor Charlemagne,

00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:31.830
whose administration then launched
a policy of musical standardisation

00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:33.950
to ensure that everyone
else followed suit.

00:21:33.950 --> 00:21:37.070
As a result, new documentation
was created to specify

00:21:37.070 --> 00:21:39.740
what liturgical repertories
should be performed

00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:41.590
and, more importantly for our purposes,

00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:43.080
how they should be performed.

00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:45.550
This is quite probably when
the first type of notation,

00:21:45.550 --> 00:21:47.990
referred to as 'neumatic notation',

00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:49.010
was invented.

00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:50.360
And it was crap.

00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:52.590
Initially, neumes were little squiggles

00:21:52.590 --> 00:21:54.210
that sat above the words of a chant,

00:21:54.210 --> 00:21:56.470
to give the singer a sense
of melodic direction.

00:21:56.470 --> 00:21:57.700
In terms of pitch,

00:21:57.700 --> 00:22:00.770
this notation indicated whether
the singer should go up or down,

00:22:00.770 --> 00:22:02.060
but it wasn’t very precise

00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:04.290
and was mainly useful for
jogging your memory.

00:22:04.290 --> 00:22:06.450
You still needed to be
taught the song first.

00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:08.730
Rhythm was not notated at this point.

00:22:08.730 --> 00:22:10.510
Like the vocal music
of the ancient Greeks,

00:22:10.510 --> 00:22:11.730
it was instead derived

00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:13.900
from the syllables of the
words that were sung.

00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:15.790
One fun thing about this notation

00:22:15.790 --> 00:22:17.790
was how it visualised
the common practice of

00:22:17.790 --> 00:22:20.130
lengthening certain
words for dramatic effect,

00:22:20.130 --> 00:22:22.580
by placing additional
neumes between syllables.

00:22:22.890 --> 00:22:25.210
Take this example of a fairly
extreme lengthening

00:22:25.210 --> 00:22:26.330
of the word ‘jubilate’:

00:22:26.330 --> 00:22:26.890
🎵
of the word ‘jubilate’:

00:22:26.890 --> 00:23:01.600
🎵

00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:03.690
Anyway, early neumatic notation proved

00:23:03.690 --> 00:23:05.640
too vague and open to interpretation.

00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:06.870
As I already mentioned,

00:23:06.870 --> 00:23:08.570
it was mainly used as a memory aide

00:23:08.570 --> 00:23:11.680
and was therefore useless for
learning newly composed music,

00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:13.760
which still required direct instruction.

00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:16.360
And so, it gradually became
obvious to many people

00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:18.290
that a more precise system was needed.

00:23:18.290 --> 00:23:20.830
This was the technical and
creative challenge of the day.

00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:22.690
And it didn't have an obvious solution.

00:23:23.150 --> 00:23:25.460
Around 930 or 940 AD,

00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:27.390
a treatise of unknown authorship

00:23:27.390 --> 00:23:29.110
proposed a system we now call

00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:30.440
'Daseian notation',

00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:33.240
which was part of an effort to
fuse ancient Greek music theory

00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:34.960
with the music of the time.

00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:36.790
Pitch intervals were described vertically:

00:23:36.790 --> 00:23:38.890
tone, semitone, tone, etc.

00:23:38.890 --> 00:23:40.820
from the lowest to the highest note.

00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:41.900
And the words to be sung

00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:43.980
would move up and down
between these intervals

00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:45.530
to indicate exact pitch.

00:23:45.530 --> 00:23:46.510
This example shows

00:23:46.510 --> 00:23:49.650
how the parts for four different singers
could be displayed at the same time,

00:23:49.650 --> 00:23:52.930
making it the first ever example
of notated polyphonic music.

00:23:52.930 --> 00:23:55.290
However, this system wasn’t taken up.

00:23:55.290 --> 00:23:58.320
There were many other attempted
reforms around the same time period,

00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:01.020
which we’re unfortunately
going to have to skip through.

00:24:01.020 --> 00:24:02.200
This takes us to what is

00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:04.930
probably the most celebrated
breakthrough in notation.

00:24:05.210 --> 00:24:06.430
In the 11th century,

00:24:06.430 --> 00:24:08.670
the Benedictine monk, Guido of Arezzo,

00:24:08.670 --> 00:24:09.870
proposed a new system

00:24:09.870 --> 00:24:12.070
which synthesised many earlier ideas.

00:24:12.070 --> 00:24:13.640
Guido was, by all accounts,

00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:15.000
a man of great genius,

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.950
who also had a super sharp tongue.

00:24:17.210 --> 00:24:19.350
He hated neumatic notation
for its imprecision

00:24:19.350 --> 00:24:21.080
and didn’t have many
good things to say about

00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:23.120
teachers of vocal music who,

00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:25.360
due to the limitations
of neumatic notation,

00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:27.730
were unable to sing newly composed music.

00:24:27.730 --> 00:24:29.640
In his <i>Treatise on Sight Singing</i>,

00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:31.600
he summarised the situation like this:

00:24:31.890 --> 00:24:32.710
"For most people,"

00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:34.410
"when they learn an
art from their teacher,"

00:24:34.410 --> 00:24:37.240
"it provides a basis upon
which other skills are learned."

00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:39.380
"When little boys develop
the skills to read,"

00:24:39.380 --> 00:24:41.090
"they go on to read other books..."

00:24:41.090 --> 00:24:43.340
"But these singing-masters
and their pupils?"

00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:45.860
"Even if they sang every
day for a hundred years,"

00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:48.320
"they’d still not be able to
sing a new composition"

00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:50.140
"without prior manual instruction."

00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:52.850
"Consequently, the time they waste
with their wretched singing"

00:24:52.850 --> 00:24:55.640
"would be enough to learn the
contents of all the books in the world,"

00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:57.230
"both sacred and secular."

00:24:57.230 --> 00:24:58.310
Just goes to show,

00:24:58.310 --> 00:25:01.100
however musical practice may
change over the centuries,

00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:03.440
musical bitchiness is eternal.

00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:06.280
Now, Guido had been paying attention
to the evolution of a system

00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:08.680
Benedictines had
developed in northern Italy,

00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:11.340
which we now call 'Nonantolian notation'.

00:25:11.340 --> 00:25:13.370
This system used a broken horizontal line

00:25:13.370 --> 00:25:14.940
to indicate a fixed pitch,

00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:16.140
in this case F,

00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:19.490
which acted as a reference point for
all the other notes placed around it.

00:25:19.490 --> 00:25:22.530
These vertical lines indicate
pitches relative to F.

00:25:22.530 --> 00:25:24.400
Later, to achieve more precision,

00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:26.130
another horizontal line was added.

00:25:26.130 --> 00:25:28.280
These letters on the left
were then used to tell you

00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:31.120
what specific pitch the
horizontal lines represented.

00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:32.660
They were called 'claves',

00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:34.350
or in French, ‘clefs’.

00:25:34.350 --> 00:25:35.960
Although they look pretty innocent now,

00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:38.240
they will eventually become,
in some people’s eyes,

00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:40.600
one of the great Satans of music notation.

00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:42.740
We’ll be having fun with clefs later.

00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:45.430
Anyway, improving on Nonantolian notation,

00:25:45.430 --> 00:25:46.890
Guido championed the use of

00:25:46.890 --> 00:25:49.860
four permanent horizontal lines
for neumes to be placed on,

00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:51.630
which would indicate their precise pitch,

00:25:51.630 --> 00:25:53.640
what we now call 'staff lines'.

00:25:53.940 --> 00:25:55.750
Using that ‘Jubilate’ example again,

00:25:55.750 --> 00:25:58.330
you can already see how
much easier this is to read:

00:25:58.330 --> 00:26:26.480
🎵

00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:28.200
Guido also standardised the practice of

00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:30.980
naming the pitches after the
first 7 letters of the alphabet.

00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:33.220
Adapting the Greek concept of tetrachords,

00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:35.650
he proposed a new system of 'hexachords',

00:26:35.650 --> 00:26:37.650
a precursor to the modern scale.

00:26:37.650 --> 00:26:39.310
Apparently, all this inventiveness

00:26:39.310 --> 00:26:40.870
as well as his mouthines

00:26:40.870 --> 00:26:43.260
led to him being banished
from his monastery.

00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:44.850
So, with nowhere to call home,

00:26:44.850 --> 00:26:46.270
he travelled throughout Europe,

00:26:46.270 --> 00:26:48.130
spreading his teachings wherever he went

00:26:48.130 --> 00:26:50.920
and becoming more and
more famous as he did so.

00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:51.760
At one point,

00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:53.850
he even taught his new system to the Pope,

00:26:53.850 --> 00:26:55.430
who marvelled at its ingenuity.

00:26:55.430 --> 00:26:57.530
Basically, this was the European tour

00:26:57.530 --> 00:27:00.940
that established the core of standard
Western notation as we know it.

00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:03.290
Now, for most Gregorian plainchant,

00:27:03.290 --> 00:27:05.300
this system is basically perfect

00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:07.140
and is still used by some today,

00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:10.370
partly because neume shapes have
an advantage over modern notation

00:27:10.370 --> 00:27:12.500
in how they visually indicate
the way a singer should

00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:14.750
rise and fall from one note to the next.

00:27:14.750 --> 00:27:17.690
But of course, plainchant
wasn’t the end stage of music,

00:27:17.690 --> 00:27:20.090
and soon, new musical needs emerged

00:27:20.090 --> 00:27:22.870
which required notation to
adapt in some major ways.

00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:24.430
Until this point,

00:27:24.430 --> 00:27:26.450
choral music had mostly been simple,

00:27:26.450 --> 00:27:28.920
with all singers performing the
same melody and rhythm,

00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:30.310
regardless of group size.

00:27:30.310 --> 00:27:32.940
That was until a new concept
of polyphony emerged

00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:34.960
which involved multiple
melodies and rhythms

00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:36.790
being sung simultaneously.

00:27:36.790 --> 00:27:38.830
Neumatic notation couldn't
handle this change

00:27:38.830 --> 00:27:41.340
because it relied on the text
of a chant to convey rhythm,

00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:44.930
on the understanding that everyone
would sing the same thing in unison.

00:27:44.930 --> 00:27:47.550
When singers started singing
different parts concurrently,

00:27:47.550 --> 00:27:48.870
this system failed.

00:27:48.870 --> 00:27:50.620
While precise pitch had been addressed,

00:27:50.620 --> 00:27:52.650
accurate rhythm remained unsolved.

00:27:52.650 --> 00:27:54.870
Many different people put
their minds to this problem

00:27:54.870 --> 00:27:57.120
and a ton of variations on
how to represent time

00:27:57.120 --> 00:27:59.210
battled it out for around two centuries.

00:27:59.210 --> 00:28:00.970
It’s an era that could have its own video,

00:28:00.970 --> 00:28:03.170
but I’ll just touch on the
most important parts.

00:28:03.170 --> 00:28:05.280
First, inspired by the ancient Greeks,

00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:08.310
the concept of long notes and
short notes was introduced.

00:28:08.590 --> 00:28:09.840
In Latin, these were called

00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:12.200
the 'longa' and 'brevis' respectively.

00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:14.450
The brevis being half
the length of the longa.

00:28:14.450 --> 00:28:17.340
Over the next two centuries, as
music became more complicated,

00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:19.990
ever shorter durations came
into common usage,

00:28:19.990 --> 00:28:23.040
along with an even longer
duration called, appropriately,

00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:24.110
the ‘maxima’.

00:28:24.110 --> 00:28:26.380
In the 15th century, to aid legibility,

00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:28.650
the longer durations
became hollow, like this.

00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:30.900
Unfortunately, for everyone,

00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:33.570
there emerged a highly
complex system of ligatures,

00:28:33.570 --> 00:28:35.510
which combined different
durations together

00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:37.370
according to elaborate rhythmic rules

00:28:37.370 --> 00:28:39.020
that are not in use today.

00:28:39.020 --> 00:28:41.070
This is called 'mensural notation',

00:28:41.070 --> 00:28:43.200
which was in use until the 16th century.

00:28:43.490 --> 00:28:45.080
Mensural notation was a weird,

00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:47.180
often an overly theoretical mess,

00:28:47.180 --> 00:28:50.570
described by a ton of treatises that
regularly contradicted each other.

00:28:50.570 --> 00:28:53.560
Although I’m going to largely skip
the weirdness of mensural notation,

00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:55.460
I don’t want to completely skip it because

00:28:55.460 --> 00:28:57.060
there is some fun to be had.

00:28:57.060 --> 00:28:58.990
Okay, in the 13th century,

00:28:58.990 --> 00:29:01.940
one of the most influential
theorists, Franco of Cologne,

00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:04.500
wrote a treatise on how he
thought rhythm should work.

00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:05.990
He specified the following:

00:29:05.990 --> 00:29:07.280
If we take the brevis,

00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:09.030
it could only have two forms.

00:29:09.030 --> 00:29:10.720
A ‘perfect’ version was called

00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:12.150
the 'brevis recta'

00:29:12.150 --> 00:29:13.650
and lasted 3 beats.

00:29:13.650 --> 00:29:14.720
Why was it perfect?

00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:16.110
Well… because…

00:29:16.110 --> 00:29:17.040
Three.

00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:19.200
God and the Holy Trinity
and all that stuff.

00:29:19.510 --> 00:29:21.130
Then there was a 'brevis altera',

00:29:21.130 --> 00:29:24.160
which for some reason looked
exactly the same as a brevis recta.

00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:25.790
This duration was imperfect

00:29:25.790 --> 00:29:27.250
because it lasted 2 beats,

00:29:27.250 --> 00:29:29.970
and so was always coupled
with what Franco described as

00:29:29.970 --> 00:29:31.250
a 'minimum' duration,

00:29:31.250 --> 00:29:32.490
which lasted 1 beat.

00:29:32.490 --> 00:29:35.010
This allowed the all-important
threeness to be maintained

00:29:35.010 --> 00:29:37.060
because 1 + 2 is 3.

00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:39.580
Feel free to pause this video for
a moment to let that sink in.

00:29:39.580 --> 00:29:40.210
Anyway,

00:29:40.210 --> 00:29:42.190
God would be over the
moon about all of this

00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:44.780
because God loves to be reminded
about the number three.

00:29:45.110 --> 00:29:45.640
Right.

00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:46.950
So, according to Franco,

00:29:46.950 --> 00:29:50.020
this ‘minimum’ duration was the
shortest that could ever be sung

00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:52.930
because he felt there was no value
in singing anything shorter,

00:29:52.930 --> 00:29:54.110
so it got the name

00:29:54.110 --> 00:29:55.050
'minima'.

00:29:55.050 --> 00:29:55.790
In the U.S.,

00:29:55.790 --> 00:29:58.750
where durations are named more
sensibly than in Europe today,

00:29:58.750 --> 00:30:00.870
this is now called a ‘half note’.

00:30:00.870 --> 00:30:01.840
However, in the U.K.,

00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:04.070
where the names of durations
are completely stupid,

00:30:04.070 --> 00:30:05.970
this is now called a 'minim'.

00:30:05.970 --> 00:30:06.770
That’s right.

00:30:06.770 --> 00:30:09.220
This reasonably long duration
has a name that means

00:30:09.220 --> 00:30:11.410
‘the shortest duration possible’.

00:30:11.410 --> 00:30:12.300
Wonderful.

00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:13.460
Even better,

00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:15.350
Franco, recognising how weird it was

00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:18.590
that the brevis recta and brevis altera
looked exactly the same,

00:30:18.590 --> 00:30:20.400
suggested a visual innovation.

00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:21.310
From now on,

00:30:21.310 --> 00:30:23.650
you should always consider
this symbol to be imperfect

00:30:23.650 --> 00:30:26.880
unless “the sign of
perfection was added to it”.

00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:28.850
The sign in question was a little dot.

00:30:28.850 --> 00:30:30.750
Now you know it’s the brevis recta,

00:30:30.750 --> 00:30:32.000
which adds up to 3.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.260
In the U.K., this sign became known as

00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:35.720
‘The prick of perfection’.

00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:37.420
And I honestly think
that we’re missing a trick

00:30:37.420 --> 00:30:38.960
by not calling it that anymore.

00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:41.510
Lemme just add it to the, uh,
MuseScore backlog here.

00:30:41.510 --> 00:30:42.000
Okay.

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:43.460
The upshot of this last point,

00:30:43.460 --> 00:30:45.130
is that for any musicians out there

00:30:45.130 --> 00:30:47.510
who've been adding dots
to minims (or half-notes)

00:30:47.510 --> 00:30:49.810
so that they last 3 beats rather than 2,

00:30:49.810 --> 00:30:51.100
you not have realized it,

00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:54.490
but you've been stockpiling some
serious brownie points with Jesus.

00:30:54.850 --> 00:30:56.570
If you’d like to see a
video that delves into

00:30:56.570 --> 00:30:58.370
mensural notation in more detail,

00:30:58.370 --> 00:31:00.160
the Early Music Sources YouTube channel

00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:02.810
has a great introductory video
I’d recommend watching.

00:31:03.140 --> 00:31:04.920
Anyway, despite its strangeness,

00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:07.880
the core innovation of mensural
notation was a system of symbols

00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:10.280
that described how long
a note should last for.

00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:12.430
And, using these symbols called ‘rests’,

00:31:12.430 --> 00:31:14.390
how long a silence should last for.

00:31:14.390 --> 00:31:15.830
So in a 4-beat bar,

00:31:15.830 --> 00:31:18.380
this is a whole note, which lasts 4 beats.

00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:19.940
Half notes are 2 beats long.

00:31:19.940 --> 00:31:21.730
Quarter notes are 1 beat long.

00:31:21.730 --> 00:31:22.820
They continue to halve

00:31:22.820 --> 00:31:23.810
and then halve again

00:31:23.810 --> 00:31:25.700
until we get to durations so miniscule

00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:27.140
no one would practically use them.

00:31:27.140 --> 00:31:28.800
With this innovation out of the way,

00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:31.690
the core of standard notation
as we know it was established,

00:31:31.690 --> 00:31:35.010
ending this module on how standard
Western notation came to be.

00:31:35.010 --> 00:31:36.410
If there’s anyone left watching,

00:31:36.410 --> 00:31:38.100
please check out my reading list because

00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:40.060
there’ll be an exam at
the end of the semester.

00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:41.290
And for those wondering,

00:31:41.290 --> 00:31:43.090
"Hold on, what about all
the other refinements"

00:31:43.090 --> 00:31:45.050
"that were introduced over
the following centuries?"

00:31:45.050 --> 00:31:46.240
You’re- You're clever!

00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:47.020
But don’t worry.

00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:48.630
I’m going to weave those points in

00:31:48.630 --> 00:31:50.340
throughout the second part of this video.

00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:07.120
Right.

00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:08.190
Let’s start with...

00:32:08.190 --> 00:32:09.040
the notes.

00:32:09.250 --> 00:32:10.080
THE NOTES!

00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:12.260
As mentioned earlier, our current system

00:32:12.260 --> 00:32:13.880
names notes alphabetically:

00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:15.910
'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G',

00:32:15.910 --> 00:32:17.738
at which point you come back to 'A' again.

00:32:17.740 --> 00:32:18.840
Each of these notes—

00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:19.810
let’s take G—

00:32:19.810 --> 00:32:20.500
🎵

00:32:20.500 --> 00:32:21.640
can be either sharpened,

00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:23.170
which is specified by this symbol:

00:32:23.170 --> 00:32:24.230
🎵

00:32:24.230 --> 00:32:26.510
or flattened, which is
represented by this symbol:

00:32:26.510 --> 00:32:27.670
🎵

00:32:27.670 --> 00:32:30.820
Sharps or flats are the black notes
on a piano, if you’re interested.

00:32:31.100 --> 00:32:33.370
If we spell the notes using
sharps rather than flats,

00:32:33.370 --> 00:32:35.160
we get: A, A-sharp, B,

00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:36.320
C, C-sharp, D,

00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:37.520
D-sharp, E, F,

00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:39.000
F-sharp, G, G-sharp.

00:32:39.230 --> 00:32:40.440
12 notes in total.

00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:41.000
[INFO BLAST]

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:43.140
So, what’s the best way
to arrange these notes?

00:32:43.140 --> 00:32:44.360
Well, as I’ve shown earlier,

00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:46.960
music initially tried to
describe them using at first

00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:47.830
no lines,

00:32:47.830 --> 00:32:48.520
then 1,

00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:49.340
then 2,

00:32:49.340 --> 00:32:49.980
4,

00:32:49.980 --> 00:32:52.130
and then finally—
after a few variations—

00:32:52.130 --> 00:32:54.830
seems to have landed on
5 as the Goldilocks ideal.

00:32:54.830 --> 00:32:57.668
But critics of this system have
two major problems with it.

00:32:57.670 --> 00:32:59.770
The first is the use of these symbols.

00:32:59.770 --> 00:33:00.850
Why do we need them?

00:33:00.850 --> 00:33:03.770
The second is related to an oddity
in how instruments are tuned,

00:33:03.770 --> 00:33:05.370
which you may have already noticed.

00:33:05.370 --> 00:33:07.730
Namely, that there’s
no sharp (or flat) note

00:33:07.730 --> 00:33:08.940
between B and C

00:33:08.940 --> 00:33:10.830
and also none between E and F.

00:33:10.830 --> 00:33:12.260
(Which is why there are no black notes)

00:33:12.260 --> 00:33:14.350
(here or here on a piano, by the way)

00:33:14.350 --> 00:33:16.050
This means that in standard notation,

00:33:16.050 --> 00:33:18.730
even though these two pairs of
notes look the same physically,

00:33:18.730 --> 00:33:20.920
the distance between
these notes is 1 semitone:

00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:22.490
🎵

00:33:22.490 --> 00:33:24.630
The distance between
these notes is 2 semitones:

00:33:24.630 --> 00:33:26.710
🎵

00:33:26.710 --> 00:33:29.170
Many critics have argued
that this is illogical.

00:33:29.170 --> 00:33:31.080
That distances which
look exactly the same,

00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:32.660
should not be musically different.

00:33:32.660 --> 00:33:33.540
And they’re not wrong.

00:33:33.540 --> 00:33:35.750
It would be preferable if
everything was uniform.

00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:37.780
One proposed solution is what’s called

00:33:37.780 --> 00:33:39.230
a 'chromatic staff',

00:33:39.230 --> 00:33:41.010
where each note,
including the sharp notes,

00:33:41.010 --> 00:33:42.470
all have their own unique space,

00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:44.027
so distance is clearer.

00:33:44.029 --> 00:33:46.760
However, this system comes
with compromises of its own.

00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:48.820
Yes, it removes the
need for these symbols,

00:33:48.820 --> 00:33:50.950
and represents pitch
distance more accurately,

00:33:50.950 --> 00:33:53.200
but is more vertically
complex as a result.

00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:54.160
What do I mean?

00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:55.430
Well, two things.

00:33:55.430 --> 00:33:57.040
The first relates to scales.

00:33:57.040 --> 00:33:58.780
A typical scale has 7 notes.

00:33:58.780 --> 00:34:00.320
For example, D major is

00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:03.040
D, E, F-sharp, G, A, B, and C-sharp.

00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:05.650
To simplify things, we often
refer to these numerically.

00:34:05.650 --> 00:34:06.880
The '1st' of the scale,

00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:08.670
the '5th' of the scale. et cetera.

00:34:08.670 --> 00:34:09.570
In standard notation,

00:34:09.570 --> 00:34:10.530
this is a 2nd:

00:34:10.530 --> 00:34:11.420
1, 2.

00:34:11.420 --> 00:34:12.270
This is a 3rd:

00:34:12.270 --> 00:34:13.240
1, 2, 3.

00:34:13.240 --> 00:34:14.760
This is a flattened 2nd.

00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:16.290
This is a flattened 3rd.

00:34:16.290 --> 00:34:17.640
In a chromatic scale,

00:34:17.640 --> 00:34:18.560
this is a 2nd:

00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:19.480
1, 2, 3.

00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:20.370
This is a 3rd:

00:34:20.370 --> 00:34:21.900
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:34:21.900 --> 00:34:23.020
This is a flattened 2nd:

00:34:23.020 --> 00:34:23.890
1, 2.

00:34:23.890 --> 00:34:25.110
The is a flattened 3rd:

00:34:25.110 --> 00:34:26.300
1, 2, 3, 4.

00:34:26.530 --> 00:34:28.030
The second reason is physical.

00:34:28.030 --> 00:34:30.367
It’s harder to read pitch distance
on a chromatic scale

00:34:30.369 --> 00:34:33.320
because it gets more difficult to
immediately recognise intervals

00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:35.040
the more spaces you have to count.

00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:37.220
6ths and 7ths in standard notation

00:34:37.220 --> 00:34:39.210
already take a bit more
time to get used to,

00:34:39.210 --> 00:34:41.820
although, weirdly, octaves
are pretty easy to recognise.

00:34:42.090 --> 00:34:43.770
So if we take these two points together:

00:34:43.770 --> 00:34:45.860
If you see a 5th in standard notation

00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:47.360
(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:48.360
and it has a sharp,

00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:49.890
you know it’s a sharpened 5th.

00:34:49.890 --> 00:34:51.240
In chromatic notation,

00:34:51.240 --> 00:34:52.630
you’d have to count 9 spaces,

00:34:52.630 --> 00:34:55.100
and the relationship to the scale
will be harder to understand.

00:34:55.620 --> 00:34:57.660
Moreover, these symbols
in standard notation

00:34:57.660 --> 00:34:59.450
are kind of one-time problems.

00:34:59.450 --> 00:35:02.090
You have to learn how they work and
become accustomed to reading them,

00:35:02.090 --> 00:35:03.000
and then that’s it.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:04.340
A note can be a something

00:35:04.340 --> 00:35:06.020
or it can be a flat something.

00:35:06.020 --> 00:35:06.770
You got it.

00:35:06.770 --> 00:35:10.280
Extending the vertical range to get rid
of these symbols is, in my opinion,

00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:12.510
trading a short-term complexity problem

00:35:12.510 --> 00:35:14.650
for a much more permanent
complexity problem.

00:35:14.940 --> 00:35:17.630
Anyway, this is the reason
chromatic staves have never caught on.

00:35:17.930 --> 00:35:21.370
But despite that, they’re probably the
most commonly proposed reform.

00:35:21.370 --> 00:35:23.870
This one was proposed by
August Wilhelm Ambro

00:35:23.870 --> 00:35:25.030
in 1883.

00:35:25.030 --> 00:35:26.440
It’s a 6-line staff,

00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:29.070
although 3 of the lines are straight
and 3 lines are dotted.

00:35:29.070 --> 00:35:32.200
An attempt to aid legibility that was
never practically put to the test.

00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:34.590
Here’s another one proposed in 1764—

00:35:34.590 --> 00:35:35.798
a 7-line staff.

00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:37.390
Here’s another from 1896—

00:35:37.390 --> 00:35:39.710
an 8-line staff, with two larger gaps.

00:35:39.710 --> 00:35:41.430
Why? Because it matches the layout

00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:42.990
of the black keys on a piano.

00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:45.860
You’re going to be seeing a lot of
this kind of piano-matching

00:35:45.860 --> 00:35:47.500
throughout the rest of
this video, by the way.

00:35:47.910 --> 00:35:50.180
Now, I don’t want to push too
hard on the chromatic staff.

00:35:50.180 --> 00:35:51.220
It’s not illogical,

00:35:51.220 --> 00:35:53.660
and there’s a reason why so
many people have proposed it.

00:35:53.660 --> 00:35:57.210
It just hasn’t captured the imagination of
enough musicians to make a difference,

00:35:57.210 --> 00:36:00.400
and the explanations I’ve given here
are my best guess as to why.

00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:02.960
However, to verify this, there would
need to be serious research

00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:06.320
conducted on beginners over
a period of probably 4 to 5 years.

00:36:06.690 --> 00:36:09.020
For any ambitious
post-doc students out there,

00:36:09.020 --> 00:36:10.070
it’s all yours!

00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:19.850
So let’s look at vertical space.

00:36:19.850 --> 00:36:22.540
Notes can keep going up until
you reach a pitch so high,

00:36:22.540 --> 00:36:24.110
it can’t be played by anything.

00:36:24.110 --> 00:36:26.710
Same thing if you go downwards
to the lowest playable pitch.

00:36:27.110 --> 00:36:29.100
If we tried to represent
this entire range.

00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:31.380
there’d be a ridiculous
number of lines and spaces,

00:36:31.380 --> 00:36:33.470
most of which would be totally redundant,

00:36:33.470 --> 00:36:35.390
since most instruments and singing voices

00:36:35.390 --> 00:36:37.410
can only play within narrow ranges,

00:36:37.410 --> 00:36:38.960
like this

00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:40.040
or this.

00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:41.660
To get rid of this redundancy,

00:36:41.660 --> 00:36:43.990
a set of symbols called
'clefs' were developed

00:36:43.990 --> 00:36:46.990
to indicate what section of the
overall range you’re looking at,

00:36:46.990 --> 00:36:49.470
which allows you to exclude
the bits that aren’t relevant.

00:36:49.470 --> 00:36:50.190
For example,

00:36:50.190 --> 00:36:52.460
this treble clef means
you are looking up here.

00:36:52.460 --> 00:36:54.820
This bass clef means
you are looking down here.

00:36:54.820 --> 00:36:57.660
Now, if we return to disrupter
Tim Sweeny’s tweet

00:36:57.660 --> 00:36:58.740
(and follow-on tweets),

00:36:58.740 --> 00:37:00.040
clefs are—in his opinion—

00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:01.990
one of the major crimes of notation,

00:37:01.990 --> 00:37:04.810
which his proposed solution—
the piano roll—fixes

00:37:04.810 --> 00:37:06.800
because the full range is always exposed,

00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:08.390
so no need for clefs.

00:37:08.390 --> 00:37:11.090
Now, I use the piano roll for
producing music all the time.

00:37:11.090 --> 00:37:12.600
I couldn’t really do without it,

00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:14.970
but is it a better system
for reading music?

00:37:14.970 --> 00:37:16.410
Well, not really.

00:37:16.410 --> 00:37:18.700
And it’s kind of hard to know
where to start here, but...

00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:20.650
let’s start with Tim’s smug assumption

00:37:20.650 --> 00:37:22.450
that by championing the piano roll,

00:37:22.450 --> 00:37:25.190
he is doing away with the old
and bringing in the new,

00:37:25.190 --> 00:37:28.500
because this idea is not even
remotely close to new.

00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:29.480
On the contrary,

00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:32.510
it has been proposed numerous
times over the last 2 centuries.

00:37:32.510 --> 00:37:34.560
The first documented proposal of this idea

00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:37.830
was by Karl Christian
Friedrich Krause in 1811.

00:37:37.830 --> 00:37:39.630
Although it failed to make any impact,

00:37:39.630 --> 00:37:42.040
it was remarkably innovative for its time.

00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:43.350
Like the modern piano roll,

00:37:43.350 --> 00:37:45.080
the entire playable range is displayed,

00:37:45.080 --> 00:37:46.810
removing the need for clefs.

00:37:46.810 --> 00:37:48.530
The duration of notes was represented—

00:37:48.530 --> 00:37:49.540
not by symbols—

00:37:49.540 --> 00:37:51.080
but by linear rectangles.

00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:53.430
He argued this was way
more visually intuitive.

00:37:53.430 --> 00:37:55.030
A quarter note would look like this,

00:37:55.030 --> 00:37:56.460
a half note (or minim)

00:37:56.460 --> 00:37:58.560
which is twice as long
would look like this,

00:37:58.560 --> 00:37:59.370
and so on.

00:37:59.370 --> 00:38:03.060
This is a concept the composer and
music scholar Gardner Read observed:

00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:06.130
"...was to be constantly rediscovered
by composers and theorists"

00:38:06.130 --> 00:38:08.630
"throughout the 19th century
and into our own time.”

00:38:08.630 --> 00:38:11.690
Indeed, the idea was proposed again—
with some small differences—

00:38:11.690 --> 00:38:13.810
by an anonymous academic in 1837

00:38:13.810 --> 00:38:15.530
and many times again after that.

00:38:15.530 --> 00:38:17.510
It’s worth mentioning
that the piano roll is

00:38:17.510 --> 00:38:20.120
itself a variant of the
chromatic staff idea.

00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:21.680
And just like the chromatic staff,

00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:24.150
it suffers from the same
vertical interval problem.

00:38:24.150 --> 00:38:24.940
That aside,

00:38:24.940 --> 00:38:27.110
physical space in general is a problem.

00:38:27.110 --> 00:38:29.420
Using the modern
piano roll as our example,

00:38:29.420 --> 00:38:31.970
how can it be used to
perform a piece of music?

00:38:31.970 --> 00:38:33.410
Well, let’s start with printing,

00:38:33.410 --> 00:38:36.810
still the predominant method used
today by performing musicians.

00:38:36.810 --> 00:38:39.620
Clearly, no matter what way you
arrange a piano roll that’s this tall,

00:38:39.620 --> 00:38:41.040
a printed page is only going to hold

00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:43.930
a really small amount of music
compared to standard notation,

00:38:43.930 --> 00:38:45.610
meaning far more page turns,

00:38:45.610 --> 00:38:46.610
far more paper,

00:38:46.610 --> 00:38:47.610
which in turn means

00:38:47.610 --> 00:38:49.880
far more rustling, movement and mistakes.

00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:50.770
[INFO BLAST]

00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:52.290
Okay, printing is out.

00:38:52.290 --> 00:38:53.460
That’s pretty clear.

00:38:53.460 --> 00:38:55.300
So, I guess it’s only fair to focus on

00:38:55.300 --> 00:38:57.160
large tablet devices instead.

00:38:57.560 --> 00:38:59.230
Oh, it’s the exact same problem.

00:38:59.230 --> 00:39:01.040
Far less music on the screen, which means

00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:03.110
tons more pages to keep cycling through.

00:39:03.430 --> 00:39:06.830
Okay, so the way musicians
overwhelmingly prefer to arrange music—

00:39:06.830 --> 00:39:08.020
via a page view—

00:39:08.020 --> 00:39:09.020
is also out.

00:39:09.020 --> 00:39:12.220
Which means the only real answer
is a continuous scrolling view.

00:39:12.220 --> 00:39:13.500
Ah! Here we go.

00:39:13.500 --> 00:39:14.020
Finally!

00:39:14.020 --> 00:39:16.870
I knew there was going to be some
advantage that piano roll had over...

00:39:16.870 --> 00:39:17.460
NO.

00:39:17.460 --> 00:39:19.960
Notation has worked in
continuous view for decades.

00:39:20.470 --> 00:39:22.930
So, let’s look at how
durations are visualised.

00:39:22.930 --> 00:39:25.200
This tends to be one of the
most beguiling reforms

00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:28.540
because it appears to be much more
obviously intuitive at first glance.

00:39:28.540 --> 00:39:29.810
Tim Sweeny thinks that

00:39:29.810 --> 00:39:33.190
symbolic representation of
duration is completely stupid:

00:39:33.190 --> 00:39:36.090
"Adding more tail feathers
to a note makes it go faster,"

00:39:36.090 --> 00:39:38.490
"like some sort of
genetically engineered bird."

00:39:38.690 --> 00:39:40.590
Now, I hate to ruin a joke, Tim...

00:39:40.590 --> 00:39:42.320
but it’s not really about speed, is it?

00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:43.590
It’s about note length.

00:39:43.590 --> 00:39:45.370
They’re not faster, they’re shorter.

00:39:45.370 --> 00:39:47.120
I know that might seem
like the same thing.

00:39:47.580 --> 00:39:50.360
Either system would probably
work equally as well at early grades

00:39:50.360 --> 00:39:52.310
because the rhythms involved are so basic.

00:39:52.310 --> 00:39:54.720
It’s just when you go
beyond the absolute basics

00:39:54.720 --> 00:39:56.340
to include more nuanced rhythms

00:39:56.340 --> 00:39:58.720
that piano-roll visualisation suffers.

00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:00.920
If a performer was trying
to sight-read this passage,

00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:02.680
they’d be forgiven for not realising that

00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:03.850
these durations and

00:40:03.850 --> 00:40:05.700
these durations are actually different,

00:40:05.700 --> 00:40:07.660
so sight-reading would be much harder.

00:40:07.660 --> 00:40:08.820
These are actually tuplets,

00:40:08.820 --> 00:40:11.060
which are much easier to
read in standard notation.

00:40:11.650 --> 00:40:12.440
The point is,

00:40:12.440 --> 00:40:14.030
relative length has to be measured

00:40:14.030 --> 00:40:15.670
and has to be judged every time.

00:40:15.670 --> 00:40:17.670
Symbolic representations don’t.

00:40:17.670 --> 00:40:20.380
This advantage that
symbolism has over literalism

00:40:20.380 --> 00:40:23.030
is why the English language
uses these abstractions

00:40:23.030 --> 00:40:24.620
rather than mouth pictograms,

00:40:24.620 --> 00:40:25.990
which one could argue are

00:40:25.990 --> 00:40:27.790
'more intuitive for beginners’.

00:40:28.270 --> 00:40:29.160
But we’re not done.

00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:31.130
Now, as I mentioned at
the start of this video,

00:40:31.130 --> 00:40:33.040
many of those who put proposals forward

00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:34.690
are usually not thinking globally.

00:40:34.690 --> 00:40:37.060
Typically, they usually focus
on their own instrument

00:40:37.060 --> 00:40:39.860
and overwhelmingly
fail to consider cases like,

00:40:39.860 --> 00:40:42.450
well, players don’t always perform solo.

00:40:42.450 --> 00:40:44.590
Take the common case where
a player wants to be able to see

00:40:44.590 --> 00:40:46.500
what another player is performing.

00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:48.440
Oh god, that means two piano rolls!

00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:50.290
Or, I guess it could be one piano roll

00:40:50.290 --> 00:40:53.450
where each performer is represented
in different colours or something?

00:40:53.450 --> 00:40:55.650
Which means a piano player in a piano trio

00:40:55.650 --> 00:40:57.270
would see something like this?

00:40:57.270 --> 00:40:59.180
Composers writing for a wind ensemble

00:40:59.180 --> 00:41:01.490
would be looking at
something like- like this?

00:41:01.490 --> 00:41:02.670
And conductors?

00:41:02.670 --> 00:41:04.550
Jesus, how on earth
would you conduct this?

00:41:04.550 --> 00:41:07.340
No, it would have to be
multiple piano rolls, wouldn’t it?

00:41:07.340 --> 00:41:08.100
Which means,

00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:10.220
you’d have to narrow the
range of each piano roll

00:41:10.220 --> 00:41:11.740
to make them fit on the page.

00:41:11.740 --> 00:41:12.670
But then...

00:41:12.670 --> 00:41:13.560
Oh, no!

00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:15.570
Since the notes here are out of view,

00:41:15.570 --> 00:41:18.060
you need some kind of way
to scroll down to see them!

00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:20.610
Aww, that’s why clefs exist, isn’t it?

00:41:20.610 --> 00:41:22.970
So you can see notes in
different ranges because

00:41:22.970 --> 00:41:25.120
gigantic grids are, generally speaking,

00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:26.830
incredibly impractical.

00:41:26.830 --> 00:41:29.680
So, I guess you’d have to
plonk another piano roll here.

00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:30.710
That’s just a clef.

00:41:30.710 --> 00:41:34.130
It’s just a far more visually noisy
clef that only pianists can read.

00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:37.320
“What is the benefit of a
position on in treble clef"

00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:40.630
"representing a different note than
the same position on bass clef?"

00:41:40.630 --> 00:41:42.910
"What is the benefit of two
notes an octave apart on..."

00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:44.840
Jesus, this is hard to read.

00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:47.220
Well, I hope I’ve explained
the benefit to you, Tim.

00:41:47.220 --> 00:41:48.410
Now, toddle off,

00:41:48.410 --> 00:41:50.570
design some more dark-pattern loot boxes.

00:41:50.970 --> 00:41:52.420
Daddy’ll take it from here.

00:41:53.040 --> 00:41:54.580
Now, for those who are still doubtful,

00:41:54.580 --> 00:41:56.420
just bear in mind that the piano roll

00:41:56.420 --> 00:42:00.200
is far more predominantly used in
music creation today than notation.

00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:01.840
Every DAW has a piano roll.

00:42:01.840 --> 00:42:03.740
So, with that in mind, you would think

00:42:03.740 --> 00:42:05.630
that if the piano roll was
suitable as a system

00:42:05.630 --> 00:42:07.650
for reading music during a performance,

00:42:07.650 --> 00:42:10.840
people would have started using it
organically for that purpose by now.

00:42:10.840 --> 00:42:12.620
I threw a really quick poll on Twitter

00:42:12.620 --> 00:42:14.560
to ask whether people
had ever seen it done,

00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:17.110
and the overwhelming response was ‘never’.

00:42:17.110 --> 00:42:18.030
Those who said 'yes'

00:42:18.030 --> 00:42:21.260
were mainly talking about livestreams
of games like Guitar Hero.

00:42:21.260 --> 00:42:23.200
And we will get to Guitar Hero.

00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:24.530
And just one last thing.

00:42:24.530 --> 00:42:27.180
I have real data at my
fingertips to go on too.

00:42:27.180 --> 00:42:28.160
A few years ago,

00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:30.100
just as I was joining MuseScore,

00:42:30.100 --> 00:42:33.740
there was a piano roll introduced on
our sister website MuseScore.com.

00:42:33.740 --> 00:42:36.920
For a time, it was even set to the
default view as an experiment

00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:39.170
to see whether people preferred
to read music that way.

00:42:39.170 --> 00:42:40.660
It was a major failure,

00:42:40.660 --> 00:42:43.730
with almost all users switching it off
and never turning it on again.

00:42:43.730 --> 00:42:45.500
Nothing about the piano roll has indicated

00:42:45.500 --> 00:42:47.100
that it is suitable for sight-reading

00:42:47.100 --> 00:42:49.750
because it has just about
no practical advantages

00:42:49.750 --> 00:42:51.900
and a myriad of obvious weaknesses.

00:42:51.900 --> 00:42:52.640
Now,

00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:53.800
onto the next topic:

00:42:54.820 --> 00:42:55.640
Clefs!

00:42:55.950 --> 00:42:57.590
Hold o- Hold on, we just spoke about this.

00:42:57.590 --> 00:42:58.620
What’s going on?

00:42:58.620 --> 00:43:00.650
Well, despite my defence of clefs,

00:43:00.650 --> 00:43:03.200
standard notation should
not get a free pass here.

00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:04.680
I’ve argued why they’re required,

00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:06.940
but not whether these are
the best ones possible.

00:43:06.940 --> 00:43:09.330
I mean, it’s hard to make
an argument that they are.

00:43:09.330 --> 00:43:11.980
It just can’t be denied that there’s
an awkwardness to them,

00:43:11.980 --> 00:43:14.960
specifically because each clef
displays notes differently.

00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:15.840
For example,

00:43:15.840 --> 00:43:18.620
the range C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C

00:43:18.620 --> 00:43:20.240
is here on a treble clef

00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:21.850
but here on an alto clef,

00:43:21.850 --> 00:43:23.210
and here on a bass clef.

00:43:23.210 --> 00:43:26.110
So, if you're learning an instrument
that uses the treble clef,

00:43:26.110 --> 00:43:27.470
you’ll soon become accustomed

00:43:27.470 --> 00:43:29.160
to the fact that C is here—

00:43:29.160 --> 00:43:32.080
and it really does screw with your head
when you try to read an alto clef

00:43:32.080 --> 00:43:33.558
where C is now here.

00:43:33.560 --> 00:43:35.240
Didn’t anyone think to revise this?

00:43:35.460 --> 00:43:36.560
Well, yes.

00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:37.660
Thousands of times.

00:43:37.660 --> 00:43:39.920
Here’s a proposal from 1672

00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:41.450
by Reverend Thomas Salmon,

00:43:41.450 --> 00:43:43.820
which garnered a little
bit of fame in its day.

00:43:43.820 --> 00:43:44.980
You have a treble clef,

00:43:44.980 --> 00:43:46.840
which uses a symbol 'Tr'.

00:43:46.840 --> 00:43:48.450
The range is G to G.

00:43:48.450 --> 00:43:50.120
Then you have a ‘Mean’ clef.

00:43:50.120 --> 00:43:50.960
Same range.

00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:51.870
Then a 'Bass' clef.

00:43:51.870 --> 00:43:52.710
Same range.

00:43:52.710 --> 00:43:53.390
Great.

00:43:53.390 --> 00:43:55.300
So when you learn one,
you’ve learned them all.

00:43:55.300 --> 00:43:58.260
A suggestion worthy of
further investigation, no?

00:43:58.260 --> 00:43:59.370
Well, you’d think so,

00:43:59.370 --> 00:44:00.810
but when this proposal was published,

00:44:00.810 --> 00:44:02.300
it was ridiculed by musicians

00:44:02.300 --> 00:44:05.200
who submitted harsh rebuttals
in subsequent publications.

00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:07.820
Reverend Salmon responded
pretty angrily to this,

00:44:07.820 --> 00:44:10.430
and a 17th-century Twitter war ensued.

00:44:10.430 --> 00:44:12.870
And this was a common
reaction to proposed reforms

00:44:12.870 --> 00:44:14.840
throughout the 18th and 19th centuries.

00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:16.290
As Gardner Read put it:

00:44:16.290 --> 00:44:18.540
“Lengthy articles in the
musical press of the time,"

00:44:18.540 --> 00:44:22.370
"even whole books attacking or defending
various reforms of notation,"

00:44:22.370 --> 00:44:24.050
"appeared with regularity."

00:44:24.050 --> 00:44:26.530
"Many eminent musicians
jumped in the verbal fray,"

00:44:26.530 --> 00:44:29.900
"adding their measure of prestige
to extolling or denouncing"

00:44:29.900 --> 00:44:31.850
"one or the other of the new systems."

00:44:32.290 --> 00:44:34.150
This kind of hyper-resistance to change

00:44:34.150 --> 00:44:35.320
is not a good look,

00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:36.890
and it does make me wonder whether we’ve

00:44:36.890 --> 00:44:40.150
lost out on some decent
optimisations as a result of it.

00:44:40.150 --> 00:44:42.660
Of course, there’s an
inertia problem here.

00:44:42.660 --> 00:44:44.290
Notation is the standard.

00:44:44.290 --> 00:44:47.530
It’s embedded in performance,
theory, technology, et cetera.

00:44:47.530 --> 00:44:48.570
It’s hard to change

00:44:48.570 --> 00:44:50.190
even when the suggestions are good.

00:44:50.190 --> 00:44:52.150
We’ll address this
problem in my conclusion,

00:44:52.150 --> 00:44:52.900
but for now,

00:44:52.900 --> 00:44:54.290
a bit of light relief,

00:44:54.290 --> 00:44:56.450
let's look at a recent notation reform:

00:44:59.620 --> 00:45:01.430
The 'Muto Method' is the creation of

00:45:01.430 --> 00:45:03.470
Japanese musician, Wataru Ohkawa.

00:45:03.470 --> 00:45:04.460
He’s a disrupter,

00:45:04.460 --> 00:45:06.020
but by no means our worst.

00:45:06.020 --> 00:45:07.910
Now, before I go into detail,
I should mention that

00:45:07.910 --> 00:45:10.440
whenever a proposed
notation reform is published,

00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:13.050
it’s almost always accompanied
by what I’m going to call

00:45:13.050 --> 00:45:14.600
a 'Big Massive Whinge'.

00:45:14.600 --> 00:45:18.630
A despairing indictment of how awful
and illogical standard notation is.

00:45:18.630 --> 00:45:22.130
The Muto Method’s hyperbole about
notation is quite something.

00:45:22.130 --> 00:45:22.970
In this case,

00:45:22.970 --> 00:45:24.590
it’s a grand conspiracy about

00:45:24.590 --> 00:45:27.650
how notation was intentionally
designed to be difficult,

00:45:27.650 --> 00:45:28.490
because

00:45:28.490 --> 00:45:30.130
(if I understand correctly)

00:45:30.130 --> 00:45:33.310
making it really difficult is
effectively a form of encryption

00:45:33.310 --> 00:45:35.410
because it limits access for most people.

00:45:35.410 --> 00:45:38.220
I’ve not actually managed
to make full sense of it yet!

00:45:38.220 --> 00:45:39.250
“Back in the old days,"

00:45:39.250 --> 00:45:41.270
"aristocrats purchased scores."

00:45:41.270 --> 00:45:43.480
"Then scores were played by performers."

00:45:43.480 --> 00:45:46.660
"Aristocrats back then patronised
their favourite performers"

00:45:46.660 --> 00:45:48.940
"and let them perform
at salons regularly."

00:45:48.940 --> 00:45:51.050
"These days, we enjoy music by playing"

00:45:51.050 --> 00:45:53.440
"encrypted song data on an iPod."

00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:56.130
"The score back then is like
encrypted song data now"

00:45:56.130 --> 00:45:59.020
"and performers back then
are like an iPod today.”

00:45:59.290 --> 00:46:00.710
Hey, performers of today!

00:46:01.160 --> 00:46:02.160
You’re an iPod!

00:46:02.450 --> 00:46:04.500
So the solution to this is...

00:46:04.500 --> 00:46:05.840
the 3-line staff.

00:46:05.840 --> 00:46:06.840
Ooooooohhh!

00:46:06.840 --> 00:46:09.120
From bottom to top,
it represents 1 octave,

00:46:09.120 --> 00:46:10.920
with the pitches arranged like this.

00:46:10.920 --> 00:46:12.530
So, no flat or sharp symbols.

00:46:12.530 --> 00:46:14.260
No clefs. Fewer lines.

00:46:14.260 --> 00:46:16.350
Now, the eagle-eyed among
you may notice that

00:46:16.350 --> 00:46:19.640
there are notes arranged in various
positions between these lines.

00:46:19.960 --> 00:46:20.960
What’s that about?

00:46:20.960 --> 00:46:23.480
Well, that’s because there
are actually 2 lines here

00:46:23.480 --> 00:46:24.730
and 2 lines here.

00:46:24.730 --> 00:46:25.380
But...

00:46:25.380 --> 00:46:27.090
that’s 7 lines, you might say?

00:46:27.090 --> 00:46:27.710
NO!

00:46:27.710 --> 00:46:30.210
Because, as the Muto Method
helpfully explains,

00:46:30.210 --> 00:46:31.470
these blue lines are ones

00:46:31.470 --> 00:46:33.400
you should imagine in your mind.

00:46:33.690 --> 00:46:34.540
That’s useful,

00:46:34.540 --> 00:46:36.460
although one wonders
why we should stop there?

00:46:36.460 --> 00:46:38.160
Why not imagine everything in our minds?

00:46:38.500 --> 00:46:40.450
There’s really not much
to say about this reform.

00:46:40.450 --> 00:46:43.940
It's just a less good version of dozens
of proposals that have come before,

00:46:43.940 --> 00:46:45.980
some of which I’ve already touched on.

00:46:45.980 --> 00:46:47.490
What I do want to address is that

00:46:47.490 --> 00:46:49.460
big whinge about ‘aristocrats’.

00:46:49.460 --> 00:46:51.150
That’s worth digging into for a moment,

00:46:51.150 --> 00:46:53.490
because it reveals a
very common association

00:46:53.490 --> 00:46:55.400
that standard notation suffers from.

00:46:55.400 --> 00:46:57.950
In my recent video about musical elitism,

00:46:57.950 --> 00:47:01.550
I spent a bit of time describing how
classical music has an image problem.

00:47:01.550 --> 00:47:03.040
In one section, I discussed

00:47:03.040 --> 00:47:05.330
the general unfairness
of musical education,

00:47:05.330 --> 00:47:08.270
using secondary schools
in the U.K. as my example.

00:47:08.270 --> 00:47:09.090
In short,

00:47:09.090 --> 00:47:11.890
you are more likely to have a wide
and varied musical education,

00:47:11.890 --> 00:47:13.830
including classes on how to read music,

00:47:13.830 --> 00:47:15.230
if your parents are wealthy.

00:47:15.230 --> 00:47:16.120
As a consequence,

00:47:16.120 --> 00:47:19.970
I often see notation itself associated
with unfairness and elitism,

00:47:19.970 --> 00:47:21.900
which I think is just illogical.

00:47:21.900 --> 00:47:24.480
Imagine a world where only the
wealthy could read and write.

00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:26.870
That would mean that most people
in the English-speaking world

00:47:26.870 --> 00:47:29.290
would not be able to
understand these symbols,

00:47:29.290 --> 00:47:31.020
which would be very unfair,

00:47:31.020 --> 00:47:33.080
but that unfairness would be social.

00:47:33.080 --> 00:47:34.770
The problem would not be the alphabet,

00:47:34.770 --> 00:47:35.970
it would be access.

00:47:35.970 --> 00:47:38.140
This is also true of musical notation.

00:47:38.140 --> 00:47:40.440
Today, it’s simply not
prioritised in education

00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:42.200
in the same way reading and writing is,

00:47:42.200 --> 00:47:44.330
which means that children
of low-income families

00:47:44.330 --> 00:47:46.820
are less likely to get an
opportunity to learn it,

00:47:46.820 --> 00:47:49.460
but there is no quality in
the alphabet or in notation

00:47:49.460 --> 00:47:51.830
that makes it either
elitist or exclusionary.

00:47:51.830 --> 00:47:55.390
Yet, on multiple occasions I've seen
notation being held up as the culprit,

00:47:55.390 --> 00:47:56.860
which makes no sense to me.

00:47:56.860 --> 00:47:59.380
We don’t do this for other things that
need to be studied to be mastered,

00:47:59.380 --> 00:48:00.820
like computer science.

00:48:00.820 --> 00:48:01.350
[INFO BLAST]

00:48:01.350 --> 00:48:03.440
I suspect notation gets
this rough treatment

00:48:03.440 --> 00:48:06.160
due to that kind of vague,
confused connection

00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:08.770
we saw in that Muto Method
quote, linking it to

00:48:08.770 --> 00:48:11.460
‘aristocrats’ during
Mozart’s time or something.

00:48:11.460 --> 00:48:13.690
But, aside from the fact that
the European aristocracy

00:48:13.690 --> 00:48:15.370
are not responsible for notation—

00:48:15.370 --> 00:48:18.020
as I demonstrated earlier
in the history segment—

00:48:18.020 --> 00:48:19.070
even if they were,

00:48:19.070 --> 00:48:20.750
that doesn’t mean it
has to be thrown away,

00:48:20.750 --> 00:48:23.020
in the same way we haven’t
thrown away the alphabet,

00:48:23.020 --> 00:48:25.560
which aristocrats also
very much made use of.

00:48:25.810 --> 00:48:26.930
Anyway, that aside,

00:48:26.930 --> 00:48:29.600
let’s return back to the present
to look at the most successful

00:48:29.600 --> 00:48:32.660
and widely used alternative to
standard notation that exists.

00:48:32.940 --> 00:48:34.660
Prepare to not be surprised.

00:48:35.370 --> 00:48:36.210
Tablature!

00:48:36.770 --> 00:48:37.470
In essence,

00:48:37.470 --> 00:48:39.960
tablature is a physical representation
of an instrument

00:48:39.960 --> 00:48:42.150
that tells you where to put
your hands to play a note.

00:48:42.150 --> 00:48:45.420
For this video, we’ll focus on
tablature for guitar and piano.

00:48:45.900 --> 00:48:47.200
Let’s start with guitar tab.

00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:49.260
A typical tab for a standard guitar has

00:48:49.260 --> 00:48:51.310
6 lines, representing each string.

00:48:51.310 --> 00:48:52.900
These numbers on the strings represent

00:48:52.900 --> 00:48:55.670
the fret you need to put your finger
on to play the desired note.

00:48:56.040 --> 00:48:59.140
Now, I spend a lot of time thinking
about guitar tab because these days,

00:48:59.140 --> 00:49:00.550
I now head up the product direction

00:49:00.550 --> 00:49:02.370
not just for Musescore and Audacity

00:49:02.370 --> 00:49:04.140
but also for a few more services,

00:49:04.140 --> 00:49:06.620
including the largest
tablature site in the world,

00:49:06.620 --> 00:49:07.680
Ultimate Guitar.

00:49:07.680 --> 00:49:10.010
I’m a fan of tablature because
when I started out,

00:49:10.010 --> 00:49:12.590
it allowed me to really easily
learn to play songs I liked.

00:49:12.590 --> 00:49:13.800
And if that’s your goal:

00:49:13.800 --> 00:49:14.980
to learn how to play songs

00:49:14.980 --> 00:49:17.340
because you’ve no need for
sight-reading or music theory,

00:49:17.340 --> 00:49:19.450
tablature is probably
all you’ll ever need.

00:49:19.450 --> 00:49:21.170
That’s why it’s so successful.

00:49:21.170 --> 00:49:23.780
So, what’s the main difference
between tab and notation?

00:49:23.780 --> 00:49:24.850
Well, first,

00:49:24.850 --> 00:49:27.330
tab only makes sense for the
instrument you currently play.

00:49:27.330 --> 00:49:29.350
Guitar tab doesn’t work
for any other instrument.

00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:31.400
But the differences go further than that.

00:49:31.400 --> 00:49:33.440
Specifically, tablature
does not help you build up

00:49:33.440 --> 00:49:35.870
an understanding of what
notes you are actually playing.

00:49:36.150 --> 00:49:39.120
This number tells me to put my
finger on the 3rd fret of this string.

00:49:39.120 --> 00:49:39.860
Fine,

00:49:39.860 --> 00:49:41.030
but what note is it?

00:49:41.030 --> 00:49:42.720
From personal experience,
I can tell you that

00:49:42.720 --> 00:49:44.270
as I got better at playing guitar,

00:49:44.270 --> 00:49:46.000
tab started to kind of hold me back.

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:48.020
When I was a kid jamming
with other musicians,

00:49:48.020 --> 00:49:50.840
if they told me they were playing
chords with an A- or a D-sharp,

00:49:50.840 --> 00:49:52.740
I’d have to spend a few seconds
looking at my guitar

00:49:52.740 --> 00:49:54.380
to figure out where those notes were.

00:49:54.380 --> 00:49:55.950
I didn’t just automatically know,

00:49:55.950 --> 00:49:58.360
and it’s harder to build up that
closer connection to your instrument

00:49:58.360 --> 00:49:59.890
if you rely solely on tab.

00:49:59.890 --> 00:50:01.460
With notation, as you progress,

00:50:01.460 --> 00:50:03.898
you begin to internalise many
aspects of performance—

00:50:03.900 --> 00:50:04.960
learning what key you’re in

00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:07.478
and knowing what each of
these symbols mean musically.

00:50:07.480 --> 00:50:09.660
And after a while, your hands
just know where to go

00:50:09.660 --> 00:50:11.540
because you know where the notes are.

00:50:11.540 --> 00:50:12.700
So, in a nutshell,

00:50:12.700 --> 00:50:14.610
tablature tells you where
to put your fingers,

00:50:14.610 --> 00:50:17.400
whereas notation just
tells you what the music is.

00:50:17.880 --> 00:50:19.610
Another advantage of notation is that

00:50:19.610 --> 00:50:21.280
it facilitates other skills.

00:50:21.280 --> 00:50:22.860
If you have ambitions to sight-read,

00:50:22.860 --> 00:50:24.020
write music for ensembles,

00:50:24.020 --> 00:50:24.820
study theory,

00:50:24.820 --> 00:50:25.360
conduct,

00:50:25.360 --> 00:50:26.980
or play multiple instruments,

00:50:26.980 --> 00:50:28.340
notation is universal.

00:50:28.340 --> 00:50:29.750
You learn it for one instrument,

00:50:29.750 --> 00:50:31.620
now you can read notation
for all instruments.

00:50:31.910 --> 00:50:32.790
But there’s more,

00:50:32.790 --> 00:50:35.020
and this is specifically
related to sight-reading.

00:50:35.300 --> 00:50:36.820
Once you get used to notation,

00:50:36.820 --> 00:50:37.710
it’s way faster

00:50:37.710 --> 00:50:40.440
because we read it in a similar
way to how we read text.

00:50:40.440 --> 00:50:42.050
When we become accustomed to reading,

00:50:42.050 --> 00:50:44.600
we’re able to recognise the
shape of words quickly,

00:50:44.600 --> 00:50:47.150
skipping the need to process
every individual letter.

00:50:47.150 --> 00:50:49.030
.This ability is called 'chunking'.

00:50:49.030 --> 00:50:51.520
Although notation has some
differences to the written language,

00:50:51.520 --> 00:50:53.550
musicians use a similar process.

00:50:53.550 --> 00:50:56.400
For example, if we look at this
up-and-down movement of notes,

00:50:56.400 --> 00:50:59.160
the reader is able to grasp a
wider sense of direction quickly

00:50:59.160 --> 00:51:01.710
and the brain doesn’t need to
pause and consider each note.

00:51:01.710 --> 00:51:03.020
If you wrote this in tablature,

00:51:03.020 --> 00:51:05.010
the eye needs to read each
number individually

00:51:05.010 --> 00:51:06.800
so you know where exactly
to put your hand.

00:51:06.800 --> 00:51:07.940
You can’t skim it.

00:51:07.940 --> 00:51:09.150
It’s way harder to sight-read

00:51:09.150 --> 00:51:10.730
because it contains more information.

00:51:10.730 --> 00:51:12.820
It’s pictographic, not symbolic.

00:51:12.820 --> 00:51:13.720
And symbols—

00:51:13.720 --> 00:51:16.400
for example, these symbols
you are reading right now—

00:51:16.400 --> 00:51:19.090
can be much more easily read
once you get used to them.

00:51:19.090 --> 00:51:20.960
Again, I need to reinforce this point:

00:51:20.960 --> 00:51:24.030
pictograms are generally more
immediately intuitive than symbols

00:51:24.030 --> 00:51:25.700
because symbols are abstract.

00:51:25.700 --> 00:51:27.130
You need to learn what they mean.

00:51:27.130 --> 00:51:29.070
But it’s precisely this abstraction that

00:51:29.070 --> 00:51:31.180
gives musical symbols so much power.

00:51:31.180 --> 00:51:32.210
Once you know what they mean, and

00:51:32.210 --> 00:51:33.710
once your hands know where to go,

00:51:33.710 --> 00:51:35.860
they connect you much more
directly to written music

00:51:35.860 --> 00:51:37.688
and you can process it much faster.

00:51:37.690 --> 00:51:40.600
God, this is turning into an
undergrad semiotics essay.

00:51:41.080 --> 00:51:42.420
So, what about Guitar Hero?

00:51:42.420 --> 00:51:45.380
Well, along with similar games that
show you where to put your fingers.

00:51:45.380 --> 00:51:48.350
Guitar Hero is basically an
inferior type of guitar tab.

00:51:48.350 --> 00:51:49.610
Since it’s just a game,

00:51:49.610 --> 00:51:52.010
you could argue that it’s
pointless to discuss it here—

00:51:52.010 --> 00:51:53.720
but I’ve been asked by a
few people to assess it

00:51:53.720 --> 00:51:55.500
as a potential successor to notation,

00:51:55.500 --> 00:51:56.560
so I quickly will.

00:51:56.750 --> 00:51:59.060
The main problem with
Guitar Hero and its imitators

00:51:59.060 --> 00:52:01.580
is that they tell you exactly
when you should play a note,

00:52:01.580 --> 00:52:03.450
whereas notation and tab don’t.

00:52:03.450 --> 00:52:05.540
Notation and tab allow
the player the flexibility

00:52:05.540 --> 00:52:07.870
to interpret tempo and
rhythm as they please.

00:52:07.870 --> 00:52:09.780
For an example of why this is important,

00:52:09.780 --> 00:52:12.560
check out these different interpretations
of the same piece of music:

00:52:12.560 --> 00:52:21.510
🎵

00:52:21.960 --> 00:52:28.630
🎵

00:52:28.890 --> 00:52:38.530
🎵

00:52:38.530 --> 00:52:40.440
Notation allows performers to make choices

00:52:40.440 --> 00:52:42.550
about how to perform
the music rhythmically,

00:52:42.550 --> 00:52:45.940
a vital aspect of musicality that
Guitar Hero does away with.

00:52:45.940 --> 00:52:48.870
Although I see value in many of
the systems covered in this video,

00:52:48.870 --> 00:52:50.590
I don’t see value in this.

00:52:51.230 --> 00:52:52.980
So what about piano tablature?

00:52:52.980 --> 00:52:55.840
Well, there have been numerous different
types throughout the centuries,

00:52:55.840 --> 00:52:57.150
In all cases, the idea is

00:52:57.150 --> 00:53:00.260
to display the layout of a keyboard,
so you know which keys to press.

00:53:00.850 --> 00:53:01.680
'Klavarscribo'

00:53:01.680 --> 00:53:04.010
(which is Esperanto
for ‘keyboard writing’)

00:53:04.010 --> 00:53:07.100
is probably the most successful
piano tab system out there.

00:53:07.100 --> 00:53:08.070
It’s vertically arranged,

00:53:08.070 --> 00:53:10.380
with the lines indicating
the layout of a piano.

00:53:10.380 --> 00:53:11.820
Black notes get black dots.

00:53:11.820 --> 00:53:13.110
White notes get white dots.

00:53:13.340 --> 00:53:14.880
The direction of these stems indicate

00:53:14.880 --> 00:53:17.470
whether the notes should be
played by the left or the right hand.

00:53:17.770 --> 00:53:19.060
Durations are relative.

00:53:19.060 --> 00:53:20.580
If one is twice as long as another,

00:53:20.580 --> 00:53:22.150
it’ll look twice as long.

00:53:22.150 --> 00:53:23.870
It was introduced in 1931

00:53:23.870 --> 00:53:26.510
by an electrical engineer
named Cornelis Pot,

00:53:26.510 --> 00:53:28.280
although a very similar idea was proposed

00:53:28.280 --> 00:53:31.400
almost a century earlier by
Juan-Nepomuceno Adorno,

00:53:31.400 --> 00:53:34.270
and again by W. Paternoster in 1894,

00:53:34.270 --> 00:53:36.250
although this blurry shot
of the original patent

00:53:36.250 --> 00:53:38.300
is the only example I could find of it.

00:53:38.300 --> 00:53:41.540
Klavarskribo is championed by two
organisations in the Netherlands,

00:53:41.540 --> 00:53:43.380
whose mission is to expand its usage.

00:53:43.740 --> 00:53:44.660
By the 1980s,

00:53:44.660 --> 00:53:48.640
there were well over 20,000 publications
of music notated in Klavarskribo,

00:53:48.640 --> 00:53:52.090
with branches of their institute springing
up in countries all over the world,

00:53:52.090 --> 00:53:54.750
making it (with the obvious
exception of guitar tablature)

00:53:54.750 --> 00:53:57.650
the most successful notation
reform mentioned in this video,

00:53:57.650 --> 00:54:01.490
although it does seem to have declined
in usage over the last 20 or 30 years.

00:54:01.920 --> 00:54:03.870
Klavarscribo is one good example of

00:54:03.870 --> 00:54:05.860
what I think the piano roll
would need to turn into

00:54:05.860 --> 00:54:08.730
to compete as a system for
reading solo keyboard music.

00:54:08.730 --> 00:54:09.940
And if you’re thinking—

00:54:09.940 --> 00:54:12.000
"Well, it wouldn’t have
to be exactly like that..."

00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:12.850
don’t worry!

00:54:12.850 --> 00:54:16.310
Basically every variation of this type
of idea has already been proposed.

00:54:16.550 --> 00:54:18.170
There’s the Tao system, which boasts

00:54:18.170 --> 00:54:20.360
that it can teach you to
play piano in 10 minutes.

00:54:20.360 --> 00:54:22.010
Sometimes, they even say 2 minutes.

00:54:22.170 --> 00:54:23.980
“The Hao staff sheets"

00:54:23.980 --> 00:54:28.150
"carry all the information that the
traditional grand staff sheets carry..."

00:54:28.150 --> 00:54:29.880
So the only difference
is that the staff lines

00:54:29.880 --> 00:54:31.950
have been replaced with a
chromatic keyboard layout.

00:54:31.950 --> 00:54:34.290
Everything else about standard
notation stays the same.

00:54:34.700 --> 00:54:36.750
Here’s a really simple one from 1819

00:54:36.750 --> 00:54:38.720
called <i>Notation Clavigraphic</i>

00:54:38.720 --> 00:54:40.210
by L.D.F. Dumouchel.

00:54:40.500 --> 00:54:42.070
It’s a 5-line staff, where—

00:54:42.070 --> 00:54:42.830
you guessed it—

00:54:42.830 --> 00:54:44.860
the lines match the
black keys on a keyboard.

00:54:45.140 --> 00:54:46.570
For a more recent example,

00:54:46.570 --> 00:54:48.690
here’s a proposal by the
designer Alex Crouch,

00:54:48.690 --> 00:54:50.680
which did the rounds in 2015.

00:54:50.680 --> 00:54:53.930
He didn’t seem to be aware of
Klavarskribo when proposing this idea,

00:54:53.930 --> 00:54:55.590
and there are quite a few similarities.

00:54:55.860 --> 00:54:58.750
This proposal was really only
intended as a conversation starter,

00:54:58.750 --> 00:55:00.190
so it isn’t fully formed.

00:55:00.190 --> 00:55:01.880
However, that didn’t stop
people giving him

00:55:01.880 --> 00:55:04.300
a bucketload of grief
when the article came out,

00:55:04.300 --> 00:55:05.580
possibly because he titled it:

00:55:05.580 --> 00:55:07.720
‘How I’d redesign piano sheet music'.

00:55:07.990 --> 00:55:10.660
Next, here’s the inevitable
Augmented Reality app.

00:55:10.660 --> 00:55:11.980
It’s called 'Piano Vision',

00:55:11.980 --> 00:55:14.240
where the notes come at you
and tell you when to play,

00:55:14.240 --> 00:55:16.890
with the added advantage of
a big, heavy thing on your head.

00:55:16.890 --> 00:55:19.420
Here’s a worse version in
VR which just looks funny

00:55:19.420 --> 00:55:22.550
because it replaces your hands with
these rubbery looking hands instead.

00:55:22.880 --> 00:55:24.070
Reviews are terrible.

00:55:24.070 --> 00:55:26.120
By all accounts, AR is the way to go here.

00:55:26.120 --> 00:55:28.470
I could go on for another
hour about piano tablature,

00:55:28.470 --> 00:55:29.680
but I think you get the idea.

00:55:30.710 --> 00:55:32.620
🎵

00:55:32.620 --> 00:55:33.680
"Wow."

00:55:33.680 --> 00:55:35.540
"That is incredible."

00:55:35.540 --> 00:55:38.250
"I can't believe I just played this."

00:55:38.250 --> 00:55:39.610
Well, she seems to like it.

00:55:39.610 --> 00:55:40.210
I dunno.

00:55:40.210 --> 00:55:42.610
After all the whinging we’ve
seen in this video so far,

00:55:42.610 --> 00:55:44.570
it’s just nice to see a smile for once.

00:55:44.880 --> 00:55:45.560
But

00:55:45.560 --> 00:55:47.500
that's a bit of a pallet cleanser, because

00:55:47.500 --> 00:55:49.400
the whinging is only beginning.

00:55:49.750 --> 00:55:51.030
Now it's time for

00:55:52.300 --> 00:55:54.060
MUSITUDE!

00:55:54.060 --> 00:55:55.410
It’s music,

00:55:55.410 --> 00:55:56.160
but with...

00:55:56.800 --> 00:55:57.250
AAAAAAAAAA

00:55:57.250 --> 00:55:59.410
"Musitude is a music tech startup."

00:55:59.410 --> 00:56:01.420
"Um, here’s a bit of a-
a pie chart for you."

00:56:01.420 --> 00:56:03.590
"So only 3% of people can proficiently"

00:56:03.590 --> 00:56:04.990
"read music and play an instrument."

00:56:05.600 --> 00:56:08.160
"They found that 90% of
non-musicians really want to."

00:56:08.160 --> 00:56:09.320
They really want to?

00:56:09.320 --> 00:56:11.490
Wow, he’s identified a
serious market here.

00:56:11.490 --> 00:56:13.270
90% of all people.

00:56:13.270 --> 00:56:14.670
"So here’s- here's the problem they have."

00:56:14.670 --> 00:56:15.640
"They have to learn"

00:56:15.640 --> 00:56:17.150
"an unfamiliar instrument"

00:56:17.150 --> 00:56:18.770
"AND a complex language."

00:56:18.770 --> 00:56:20.210
"It’s almost like being dyslexic"

00:56:20.210 --> 00:56:21.840
"for a non-musician looking at this."

00:56:21.840 --> 00:56:23.470
Now, before we go any further,

00:56:23.470 --> 00:56:25.730
is his portrayal of the problem accurate?

00:56:25.730 --> 00:56:26.470
Well, let’s see.

00:56:26.470 --> 00:56:28.250
In nearly every Big Massive Whinge

00:56:28.250 --> 00:56:30.020
(or BMW) that I encounter,

00:56:30.020 --> 00:56:31.560
the central whinge is always that

00:56:31.560 --> 00:56:34.480
notation itself is the reason
why beginners give up.

00:56:34.480 --> 00:56:37.920
Now, the stats on people who give up
trying to learn an instrument after a year

00:56:37.920 --> 00:56:38.840
are really high.

00:56:38.840 --> 00:56:40.980
It’s a well known problem
that I discuss constantly

00:56:40.980 --> 00:56:42.740
with peers in other music companies.

00:56:43.020 --> 00:56:44.690
With Ultimate Guitar,
we’re specifically trying to

00:56:44.690 --> 00:56:46.450
find ways to engage more beginners.

00:56:46.450 --> 00:56:47.660
And what we’re finding—

00:56:47.660 --> 00:56:49.500
and what everyone else is finding too—

00:56:49.500 --> 00:56:51.740
is that needing to learn how
to read guitar tablature

00:56:51.740 --> 00:56:53.640
is not the problem beginners are facing.

00:56:53.960 --> 00:56:55.930
Their problem is way more fundamental.

00:56:55.930 --> 00:56:58.850
It’s hard to get a note to ring out
when you press your finger on a string.

00:56:58.850 --> 00:57:01.150
It’s really hard to learn how
to switch between chords.

00:57:01.150 --> 00:57:02.720
It’s hard to pluck the right strings.

00:57:02.720 --> 00:57:04.540
A lot of people get highly frustrated

00:57:04.540 --> 00:57:05.980
trying to learn how to tune a guitar.

00:57:06.290 --> 00:57:07.830
Wind instruments always squawk.

00:57:07.830 --> 00:57:08.910
Violins scratch, and

00:57:08.910 --> 00:57:10.670
it’s hard to get the
pitches to sound right.

00:57:10.670 --> 00:57:13.620
The basic physical realities of
most instruments are tough,

00:57:13.620 --> 00:57:16.340
and there’s not much magic to be
had in the first couple of days

00:57:16.340 --> 00:57:19.030
unless you have, like, a really
good teacher who can guide you.

00:57:19.030 --> 00:57:21.200
Basically, once you’re
able to play a little bit

00:57:21.200 --> 00:57:23.297
by reading simple chords above lyrics,

00:57:23.299 --> 00:57:25.200
you’ve already passed the great filter.

00:57:25.200 --> 00:57:27.510
So when a disruptor emerges to suggest

00:57:27.510 --> 00:57:29.728
that notation is the
reason beginners give up,

00:57:29.730 --> 00:57:30.890
they’re either misinformed

00:57:30.890 --> 00:57:32.680
or just intentionally duplicitous.

00:57:32.680 --> 00:57:34.960
The vast majority are not
starting with notation.

00:57:35.150 --> 00:57:36.960
So, back to the Musitude presentation—

00:57:36.960 --> 00:57:38.780
he’s identified the market opportunity—

00:57:38.780 --> 00:57:40.280
90% of all people.

00:57:40.280 --> 00:57:42.540
Now we need the classic disruptor insight,

00:57:42.540 --> 00:57:44.860
a hidden truth that makes
us sit up in our seats.

00:57:44.860 --> 00:57:47.130
"What’s interesting about
most instruments is..."

00:57:47.130 --> 00:57:48.878
"you’re really using an interface."

00:57:48.880 --> 00:57:51.250
Ah, you’re really using an interface.

00:57:51.250 --> 00:57:52.420
Hmm. Okay, I’m with you.

00:57:52.670 --> 00:57:54.840
"We recognize that there's an interface"

00:57:54.840 --> 00:57:56.810
"a lot of people already know and use."

00:57:56.810 --> 00:57:57.800
"They’re already halfway there."

00:57:57.800 --> 00:57:59.470
"They can play the interface."

00:57:59.470 --> 00:58:01.370
"Of course, they still
can’t read sheet music,"

00:58:01.370 --> 00:58:03.920
"so we invented a new kind of
sheet music to go along with it."

00:58:03.920 --> 00:58:05.550
So, this is his proposal…

00:58:05.750 --> 00:58:07.508
QWERTY keyboard tablature.

00:58:07.650 --> 00:58:10.040
"So, these are some comparative shots."

00:58:10.040 --> 00:58:12.020
"This is a Beethoven sonata,
the melody part."

00:58:12.300 --> 00:58:13.740
But hold on. Even in this example,

00:58:13.740 --> 00:58:15.190
the system doesn’t hold up, so...

00:58:15.190 --> 00:58:16.460
Right. If we look here—

00:58:16.460 --> 00:58:18.390
that’s this bar in the notation view—

00:58:18.390 --> 00:58:20.320
we can see that this
note is held for 2 beats

00:58:20.320 --> 00:58:22.420
and this note is held for 2 beats.

00:58:22.420 --> 00:58:23.200
That’s fine.

00:58:23.200 --> 00:58:25.460
So the connected circles
are 2 beats long. Got it.

00:58:25.810 --> 00:58:27.450
Now, if we look at this bar, we can see

00:58:27.450 --> 00:58:29.770
that a single circle represents 1 beat.

00:58:29.770 --> 00:58:30.300
So:

00:58:30.300 --> 00:58:32.070
dum, dum, dum, dum.

00:58:32.070 --> 00:58:32.710
Fine.

00:58:33.050 --> 00:58:34.100
But then if you look here,

00:58:34.690 --> 00:58:35.890
this note isn’t 1 beat.

00:58:35.890 --> 00:58:37.710
In the notation, it’s 1 and a half beats

00:58:37.710 --> 00:58:39.630
because it uses the prick of perfection.

00:58:39.630 --> 00:58:41.900
And these notes are twice
as long as they should be.

00:58:41.900 --> 00:58:43.410
Your rhythm is completely wrong.

00:58:43.410 --> 00:58:45.100
So even in his presentation,

00:58:45.100 --> 00:58:48.310
this guy has demonstrated a
total disinterest in actual music—

00:58:48.310 --> 00:58:51.968
or his system is just so useless, it can’t
capture basic musical performance.

00:58:51.970 --> 00:58:53.140
But the real fun part is

00:58:53.140 --> 00:58:55.820
how the notes are arranged on the
keyboard and what they're called.

00:58:55.820 --> 00:58:58.560
Okay, so the lowest note
starts on the digit 1

00:58:58.560 --> 00:58:59.880
and then goes up to 5,

00:58:59.880 --> 00:59:02.010
then A, B, C, D, E, F. G,

00:59:02.010 --> 00:59:03.600
then you proceed all the way to Z,

00:59:03.600 --> 00:59:05.750
followed by 6, 7, 8, 9, 0.

00:59:05.750 --> 00:59:07.390
Thereby ending on F#,

00:59:07.390 --> 00:59:09.730
cutting out only a few octaves
of the upper range.

00:59:09.730 --> 00:59:12.210
What do you do?
Hold caps lock to transpose?

00:59:12.210 --> 00:59:14.050
But the whinging is only getting started.

00:59:14.050 --> 00:59:15.050
According to our boy,

00:59:15.050 --> 00:59:17.060
notation is really confusing because of

00:59:17.060 --> 00:59:19.610
how the notes are named
A to G in a given octave,

00:59:19.610 --> 00:59:22.160
and then restart again
on A in the next octave.

00:59:22.700 --> 00:59:25.700
"And then you go 'A, B, C, D, E, F, G'
and then it’ll go ‘A’ again."

00:59:25.700 --> 00:59:27.950
"And- And then they use the same names"

00:59:27.950 --> 00:59:29.980
"for the next level or
set of notes above it"

00:59:29.980 --> 00:59:32.090
"and then the same name
again and then again."

00:59:32.470 --> 00:59:34.370
"It can get confusing if someone says,"

00:59:35.070 --> 00:59:36.220
"‘that’s the letter G’."

00:59:36.220 --> 00:59:37.720
I agree it would be confusing

00:59:37.720 --> 00:59:40.050
in any context if another musician
turned to you and said,

00:59:40.050 --> 00:59:41.528
"That’s the letter G".

00:59:41.530 --> 00:59:43.830
Leave your comments below
proposing musical scenarios

00:59:43.830 --> 00:59:45.840
where it would actually be
appropriate for someone to say,

00:59:45.840 --> 00:59:47.210
‘That’s the letter G’!

00:59:47.210 --> 00:59:48.670
The moment you start thinking about this,

00:59:48.670 --> 00:59:49.730
the funnier it gets.

00:59:50.020 --> 00:59:52.160
So the system, as championed by Musitude,

00:59:52.160 --> 00:59:55.250
requires that notes an octave apart
should all have different names.

00:59:55.250 --> 00:59:56.640
You need to remember that 1

00:59:56.640 --> 00:59:59.170
is the same pitch as but
an octave lower than H,

00:59:59.170 --> 01:00:01.390
which in turn is an octave lower than T,

01:00:01.390 --> 01:00:03.300
and then you’ll have to learn
that each of the other pitches

01:00:03.300 --> 01:00:05.040
also has 3 variations.

01:00:05.770 --> 01:00:07.080
What I really love about this system

01:00:07.080 --> 01:00:10.010
isn’t just that it ignores how
we commonly name notes.

01:00:10.010 --> 01:00:12.950
It's that intentionally hostile
to how we name notes.

01:00:12.950 --> 01:00:15.760
For example, 'H' in Musitude
is what we call 'G'.

01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:18.060
'A' on Musitude is what we call 'C'.

01:00:18.060 --> 01:00:20.970
So, if you're collaborating with a
musician unfamiliar with this system,

01:00:20.970 --> 01:00:22.990
you’d need to convert it
backwards, remembering that

01:00:22.990 --> 01:00:23.940
'3' is 'A',

01:00:23.940 --> 01:00:24.610
'J' is 'A',

01:00:24.610 --> 01:00:25.990
and 'V' is also 'A',

01:00:25.990 --> 01:00:27.990
making a total nuisance of yourself.

01:00:27.990 --> 01:00:30.400
And this is why Musitude
is my favourite disrupter.

01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:33.830
Because it’s intentionally incompatible
with every instrument in existence,

01:00:33.830 --> 01:00:35.390
and can only be played on a device

01:00:35.390 --> 01:00:37.850
not intended to be used
for musical performance.

01:00:37.850 --> 01:00:40.100
It has to be the most revolutionary
system I’ve ever seen

01:00:40.100 --> 01:00:42.260
in that basically nothing
can exist as it is.

01:00:42.260 --> 01:00:43.280
Everything must burn—

01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:44.570
including all music theory—

01:00:44.570 --> 01:00:46.070
so that we can all sit at our keyboards

01:00:46.070 --> 01:00:48.480
🎵
awkwardly hammering out ditties like this:

01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:53.450
🎵

01:00:53.820 --> 01:00:54.640
So, in summary,

01:00:54.640 --> 01:00:57.210
the solution for that 90% who
want to play an instrument

01:00:57.210 --> 01:00:59.860
is that they should learn something
that isn’t a musical instrument.

01:00:59.860 --> 01:01:00.730
Amazing.

01:01:00.990 --> 01:01:02.380
And also, just look at this.

01:01:02.700 --> 01:01:03.930
'The Joy Barrier'?

01:01:04.340 --> 01:01:07.080
Oh, having to learn
things is a joy barrier!

01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:09.800
I for one object to the barriers for joy.

01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:12.070
Jesus, can someone
give this man a lollipop?

01:01:12.070 --> 01:01:14.220
Along with one of those
hats with a spinner on it.

01:01:14.220 --> 01:01:15.490
If you want instant joy,

01:01:15.490 --> 01:01:16.540
go to a carnival!

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:18.220
Or take ecstacy!

01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:20.190
But if you think that whinging is bad—

01:01:20.190 --> 01:01:22.250
and I’m gonna have to issue
a whinge warning here,

01:01:22.250 --> 01:01:23.630
let me introduce you to

01:01:23.630 --> 01:01:24.500
Dodeka.

01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:27.100
“For me, it’s not logical.”

01:01:27.360 --> 01:01:28.390
“I couldn’t play.”

01:01:29.100 --> 01:01:30.970
“I always had problems with keys.”

01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:32.420
“I had to stop.”

01:01:32.860 --> 01:01:33.520
Well, you know,

01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:34.660
maybe I’m being a bit harsh.

01:01:34.660 --> 01:01:37.280
Like, it’s easy to talk about
these things in the abstract,

01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:39.760
but when you’re confronted
by testimonials like this,

01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:41.530
it’s hard to ignore what they’re saying.

01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:43.190
Unless...

01:01:43.580 --> 01:01:46.780
Unless these people are literally
the founders of Dodeca saying it.

01:01:46.780 --> 01:01:48.100
"This complexity"

01:01:48.100 --> 01:01:50.710
"leads to the loss of many
potential musicians."

01:01:50.710 --> 01:01:52.010
So yes, Moody Fonze

01:01:52.010 --> 01:01:53.460
and Professor Wheeto here

01:01:53.460 --> 01:01:55.400
are the masterminds behind this system.

01:01:55.400 --> 01:01:58.340
Here’s Professor Wheeto having a
good old whinge about notation.

01:01:58.340 --> 01:01:59.000
Oh look!

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:00.580
He’s holding a ball of tangled-up string

01:02:00.580 --> 01:02:02.030
and an image of a maze.

01:02:02.030 --> 01:02:02.840
I get it!

01:02:03.070 --> 01:02:04.960
And you’ll never guess
what their solution is?

01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:06.500
It’s a chromatic staff!

01:02:06.500 --> 01:02:07.900
This time, there are 4 lines

01:02:07.900 --> 01:02:10.540
(not including the extra 3 you
should imagine in your mind)

01:02:10.540 --> 01:02:13.600
as well as the numerous invisible
lines that exist between staves.

01:02:13.830 --> 01:02:15.780
And again, durations are relative.

01:02:15.780 --> 01:02:18.320
I’m beginning to think the main
beneficiaries of this video are

01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:20.280
the potential reformers of the future.

01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:23.320
Before you go and propose
for the 2000th time

01:02:23.320 --> 01:02:25.620
a chromatic staff with relative durations,

01:02:25.620 --> 01:02:28.320
just take a look at some of the
proposals already in existence

01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:30.110
and champion one of those instead!

01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:31.190
To be fair though,

01:02:31.190 --> 01:02:34.670
Dodeca do actually try to consider
more modern developments in music—

01:02:34.670 --> 01:02:36.460
namely microtonality—

01:02:36.460 --> 01:02:39.420
although their solution is to
use very subtle slanted angles

01:02:39.420 --> 01:02:41.080
to mean different kinds of microtone,

01:02:41.080 --> 01:02:42.820
which I find a little bit weak.

01:02:42.820 --> 01:02:46.308
But it already puts them five or six
musical levels above Musitude.

01:02:46.310 --> 01:02:49.460
Although, on the metric of pure,
unadulterated whinging,

01:02:49.460 --> 01:02:50.500
they stand alone:

01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:51.730
“Reading music?"

01:02:51.730 --> 01:02:52.680
"Me?”

01:02:52.680 --> 01:02:53.250
“No."

01:02:53.250 --> 01:02:54.620
"That was just impossible”

01:02:54.620 --> 01:02:56.780
“I thought I was stupid, but in fact"

01:02:56.780 --> 01:02:58.600
"the system is quite stupid.”

01:03:09.170 --> 01:03:11.700
For me, the aspect of notation
that I find most troubling

01:03:11.700 --> 01:03:13.320
relates to accessibility.

01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:15.490
I've not been able to
locate statistics on this,

01:03:15.490 --> 01:03:17.500
so I’ll have to rely
anecdotally on problems

01:03:17.500 --> 01:03:20.250
described to me from users
and friends over the years.

01:03:20.700 --> 01:03:22.300
Some people have trouble reading notation

01:03:22.300 --> 01:03:25.220
due to different kinds of visual
or perceptual impairment.

01:03:25.530 --> 01:03:27.670
Some readers complain of
a kind of phasing effect

01:03:27.670 --> 01:03:29.700
when trying to focus on
the lines between notes,

01:03:29.700 --> 01:03:31.630
which makes them very tricky to read,

01:03:31.630 --> 01:03:32.920
sometimes causing headaches.

01:03:33.320 --> 01:03:36.570
Some report a difficulty in
distinguishing lines from spaces.

01:03:36.570 --> 01:03:38.770
I have heard numerous
times from dyslexic readers

01:03:38.770 --> 01:03:40.850
that the tightly packed nature of notation

01:03:40.850 --> 01:03:42.140
makes it hard to parse.

01:03:42.140 --> 01:03:44.350
Vertical arrangement can become confused.

01:03:44.350 --> 01:03:46.990
Certain combinations of notes
become visually muddled.

01:03:46.990 --> 01:03:48.850
For blind users, thankfully,

01:03:48.850 --> 01:03:51.500
Louis Braille—the inventor
whose namesake became

01:03:51.500 --> 01:03:54.860
the universally recognised system
that allows blind people to read text—

01:03:54.860 --> 01:03:56.790
was also an experienced musician.

01:03:56.790 --> 01:03:58.280
Along with regular braille,

01:03:58.280 --> 01:04:00.460
he also devised a system of music braille,

01:04:00.460 --> 01:04:02.480
although it isn’t as
supported as it should be

01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:05.660
and requires better integration with
notation apps and screen readers.

01:04:05.990 --> 01:04:07.630
For those suffering from dyslexia,

01:04:07.630 --> 01:04:10.430
there are a few known approaches
that can improve legibility,

01:04:10.430 --> 01:04:12.260
such as using note names with noteheads,

01:04:12.260 --> 01:04:13.550
altering the staff size

01:04:13.550 --> 01:04:16.430
and using colours to help reinforce
which notes are to be played.

01:04:16.430 --> 01:04:19.340
The only trouble is that most
publicly available sheet music

01:04:19.340 --> 01:04:21.880
does not come with these
kinds of accessible variations.

01:04:21.880 --> 01:04:24.540
I’ll come back to accessibility
at the end of this video.

01:04:24.540 --> 01:04:26.180
But for now, all I’ll say is that

01:04:26.180 --> 01:04:28.490
the trouble with trying to
find an accessible standard,

01:04:28.490 --> 01:04:31.410
is that a solution for one reader
can be a barrier to another.

01:04:31.410 --> 01:04:32.340
In particular,

01:04:32.340 --> 01:04:35.050
care is needed when suggesting
approaches that use colour,

01:04:35.050 --> 01:04:37.950
since colour blindness is another
common accessibility problem.

01:04:37.950 --> 01:04:39.650
And that takes me quite neatly

01:04:39.650 --> 01:04:43.000
to what is probably the most incredible
proposal featured in this video:

01:04:47.160 --> 01:04:48.100
<i>Farbige Noten</i>.

01:04:48.540 --> 01:04:50.610
This is a proposal from
a different reality.

01:04:50.610 --> 01:04:52.710
Amazingly strange and impractical

01:04:52.710 --> 01:04:55.830
but proposed in the most
incredibly visually beautiful way,

01:04:55.830 --> 01:04:59.390
and I’m over the moon that I managed
to track down the original publication,

01:04:59.390 --> 01:05:01.618
because you have to see
how this looks in print.

01:05:01.620 --> 01:05:02.560
<i>Farbige Noten</i>,

01:05:02.560 --> 01:05:03.860
or ‘coloured notes’

01:05:03.860 --> 01:05:05.580
was published in 1888

01:05:05.580 --> 01:05:06.660
by Christian Huth.

01:05:06.660 --> 01:05:09.910
It starts with a lengthy treatise on the
relationship between colours and pitch,

01:05:09.910 --> 01:05:12.860
culminating in a proposal that
each of the 12 notes of the scale

01:05:12.860 --> 01:05:14.830
should have their own unique colour.

01:05:14.830 --> 01:05:15.910
But that’s not all.

01:05:15.910 --> 01:05:18.120
Huth goes into much more specific detail,

01:05:18.120 --> 01:05:20.510
proposing for example
that the key of C major is

01:05:20.510 --> 01:05:23.560
9 parts blue, 8 parts orange
and 7 parts yellow.

01:05:23.560 --> 01:05:27.560
C minor is 7 parts green,
6 parts orange and 5 parts blue.

01:05:27.560 --> 01:05:29.870
The notation itself is
represented as a grid.

01:05:29.870 --> 01:05:31.990
Like many of the other proposals
we’ve already looked at,

01:05:31.990 --> 01:05:33.100
durations are relative—

01:05:33.100 --> 01:05:35.190
with durations represented
by these curves.

01:05:35.190 --> 01:05:37.370
And since the grid is
pretty tight horizontally,

01:05:37.370 --> 01:05:39.790
smaller durations get
really physically cramped.

01:05:40.870 --> 01:05:42.920
The numbers here are
meant to represent octaves,

01:05:42.920 --> 01:05:45.510
which makes sense because
pitch is represented by colour

01:05:45.510 --> 01:05:47.360
so it doesn’t need to be
represented vertically.

01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:49.210
However, it gets pretty mind-bending

01:05:49.210 --> 01:05:50.570
because, for some reason,

01:05:50.570 --> 01:05:52.700
vertical placement can
sometimes be ignored

01:05:52.700 --> 01:05:54.530
and the same note can
jump around vertically

01:05:54.530 --> 01:05:58.250
according to a logic I don’t quite
trust myself to adequately explain.

01:05:58.250 --> 01:06:01.290
I think this means that
<i>Farbige Noten</i> is the only proposal

01:06:01.290 --> 01:06:04.460
which doesn’t fit into either of the
two fundamental types of notation

01:06:04.460 --> 01:06:06.170
identified by Geavert.

01:06:06.170 --> 01:06:07.100
Now, rhythmically,

01:06:07.100 --> 01:06:09.640
this proposal matches a bunch
of the others we’ve looked at.

01:06:09.640 --> 01:06:11.480
However, the question of
whether we’d be able to

01:06:11.480 --> 01:06:13.450
sight-read numerous colours
at the same time

01:06:13.450 --> 01:06:15.400
and be able to interpret them reliably

01:06:15.400 --> 01:06:17.910
is one it’s safe to say
I’m sceptical about.

01:06:17.910 --> 01:06:20.350
We tend to use colour as
an aid to other symbols

01:06:20.350 --> 01:06:22.530
but rarely as the primary symbol itself.

01:06:22.530 --> 01:06:25.630
Gardner Read’s assessment of
this proposal is pretty amusing:

01:06:25.630 --> 01:06:28.640
“This notation is so far removed
from standard practice,"

01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:30.590
"so idiosyncratic in symbology,"

01:06:30.590 --> 01:06:32.850
"and so elaborately
fanciful in construction"

01:06:32.850 --> 01:06:35.580
"that it defies professionally
objective assessment."

01:06:35.580 --> 01:06:39.180
"The analyst may be awed by the
detail and extent of Huth’s schema,"

01:06:39.180 --> 01:06:42.010
"but mystified by his
Jovian disregard of reality."

01:06:42.010 --> 01:06:42.770
And, by the way,

01:06:42.770 --> 01:06:45.500
I’ve a lot to say about the relationship
between colour and sound

01:06:45.500 --> 01:06:46.830
because, for one thing,

01:06:46.830 --> 01:06:49.040
it was the subject of
my old master's thesis.

01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:50.800
There’ll be a video about it one day.

01:06:52.070 --> 01:06:53.360
For maximum whiplash,

01:06:53.360 --> 01:06:55.520
let’s now look at what is—for my money—

01:06:55.520 --> 01:06:57.540
probably the most logical and convincing

01:06:57.540 --> 01:06:59.890
outright replacement
reform I think I’ve seen.

01:07:00.170 --> 01:07:02.050
It was proposed by Julian Carrillo—

01:07:02.050 --> 01:07:04.160
an influential microtonal composer—

01:07:04.160 --> 01:07:05.460
in 1895.

01:07:05.730 --> 01:07:07.490
First, the 12 pitches of the octave

01:07:07.490 --> 01:07:09.030
are represented by numbers.

01:07:09.030 --> 01:07:11.320
Middle-range pitches are
placed on the central line.

01:07:11.320 --> 01:07:12.920
If they’re displayed on a lower space,

01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:14.040
they’re an octave lower.

01:07:14.040 --> 01:07:15.010
Another space down,

01:07:15.010 --> 01:07:16.410
an octave lower again.

01:07:16.410 --> 01:07:18.560
A space up, an octave higher. et cetera.

01:07:18.860 --> 01:07:19.680
And that’s it.

01:07:19.680 --> 01:07:22.020
No need for flat or
sharp symbols or clefs—

01:07:22.020 --> 01:07:23.580
and it’s way more vertically efficient—

01:07:23.580 --> 01:07:26.030
as can be seen by comparing
this notated example

01:07:26.030 --> 01:07:27.780
with Carrillo’s proposed system.

01:07:28.200 --> 01:07:29.750
For sure, it would mean
that we’d have to recalibrate

01:07:29.750 --> 01:07:31.340
our relationship to music theory.

01:07:31.340 --> 01:07:32.820
For example, you’d need to learn that

01:07:32.820 --> 01:07:34.950
2, 6, 9 is a D major chord.

01:07:34.950 --> 01:07:37.310
2, 5, 9 is a D minor chord, et cetera.

01:07:37.310 --> 01:07:38.800
It messes with our heads now,

01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:40.120
but it’s completely sensible,

01:07:40.120 --> 01:07:42.880
and the numeric relationship
would always be consistent.

01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:45.540
Another reason Carrillo
created this system

01:07:45.540 --> 01:07:47.720
was so that it could accommodate
different tuning systems

01:07:47.720 --> 01:07:49.390
and microtonality too.

01:07:49.680 --> 01:07:52.300
For example, using 24-tone
equal temperament,

01:07:52.300 --> 01:07:55.240
or you could represent quarter
tones with decimals or fractions,

01:07:55.240 --> 01:07:56.130
et cetera.

01:07:56.130 --> 01:07:58.030
The two probable downsides I can see

01:07:58.030 --> 01:08:00.390
are difficulties in understanding
what key you are in

01:08:00.390 --> 01:08:02.200
or what key you are modulating to.

01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:04.980
But if I was to pick out the issue
that might cause the most trouble,

01:08:04.980 --> 01:08:07.290
my guess is it would be
how chords are visualised—

01:08:07.290 --> 01:08:08.920
I just don’t know how easy it would be

01:08:08.920 --> 01:08:11.140
for a performer to chunk
these numbers quickly,

01:08:11.140 --> 01:08:14.060
although I should mention that there are
some types of non-Western notation

01:08:14.060 --> 01:08:15.590
that use numbers in this way.

01:08:16.090 --> 01:08:18.660
We’d really need some serious
comparative data to judge

01:08:18.660 --> 01:08:20.580
how successful Carrillo’s system could be

01:08:20.580 --> 01:08:22.060
compared to standard notation.

01:08:22.060 --> 01:08:23.560
But even if it didn’t compare well,

01:08:23.560 --> 01:08:25.400
it’s an honourable attempt for sure.

01:08:34.090 --> 01:08:35.940
Now, as much as I’d love
to spend another hour

01:08:35.940 --> 01:08:37.570
going through a ton of other systems,

01:08:37.570 --> 01:08:38.910
I do fear for your brain.

01:08:38.910 --> 01:08:42.400
So I thought I’d just cycle through a
couple of other proposed reforms quickly

01:08:42.400 --> 01:08:44.520
before tying everything
up in my conclusion.

01:08:45.370 --> 01:08:46.300
Hummingbird.

01:08:46.300 --> 01:08:48.210
This one is a relatively recent proposal,

01:08:48.210 --> 01:08:50.140
and I find it quite baffling.

01:08:50.140 --> 01:08:52.600
These weird balls have
shading that indicates pitch—

01:08:52.600 --> 01:08:55.810
even though they’re still represented
vertically a-la standard notation.

01:08:55.810 --> 01:08:58.470
It’s like the authors couldn’t choose
between one idea over the other

01:08:58.470 --> 01:08:59.730
so just used both.

01:08:59.730 --> 01:09:02.060
The squiggly bits
represent sharps or flats.

01:09:02.060 --> 01:09:03.220
Durations have a little line

01:09:03.220 --> 01:09:05.160
which is meant to tell
you how long they last.

01:09:05.160 --> 01:09:07.990
These extra adjacent lines indicate 8ths.

01:09:07.990 --> 01:09:09.710
I think it’s a total nightmare to look at.

01:09:09.710 --> 01:09:11.850
Perhaps at very early
stages it might be useful,

01:09:11.850 --> 01:09:14.950
but it seems too messy and
indistinct for anything beyond that.

01:09:15.750 --> 01:09:17.110
Stenographic notation

01:09:17.110 --> 01:09:19.030
(or notation shorthand).

01:09:19.030 --> 01:09:20.960
This is not one proposal in particular,

01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:22.340
it’s an entire genre.

01:09:22.340 --> 01:09:24.700
I’m not showing these here because
I think they need to be assessed.

01:09:24.700 --> 01:09:25.930
I just think they’re fun.

01:09:25.930 --> 01:09:27.960
In 1802, John Austin proposed

01:09:27.960 --> 01:09:29.470
these symbols for pitch

01:09:29.470 --> 01:09:31.320
and these symbols for duration,

01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:33.330
which would alter this notation

01:09:33.330 --> 01:09:34.440
to look like this.

01:09:35.140 --> 01:09:37.530
Another from Harry White in 1899

01:09:37.530 --> 01:09:39.270
would represent this notation,

01:09:39.270 --> 01:09:40.340
like this.

01:09:40.340 --> 01:09:41.410
And my favourite,

01:09:41.410 --> 01:09:42.730
in 1873,

01:09:42.730 --> 01:09:44.320
Alex M. Seymat proposed

01:09:44.320 --> 01:09:46.630
the use of these symbols
to represent pitch,

01:09:46.630 --> 01:09:47.960
which means this notation

01:09:47.960 --> 01:09:49.150
would look like this.

01:09:50.590 --> 01:09:53.890
'Global Notation' is a recent
proposal by Dr. Andrew Killick

01:09:53.890 --> 01:09:56.600
from the Department of Music
at the University of Sheffield.

01:09:56.600 --> 01:09:58.430
Its purpose is to provide, quote,

01:09:58.430 --> 01:10:01.610
“...a more realistic picture of
what listeners actually hear”,

01:10:01.610 --> 01:10:03.320
by using a complex grid to represent

01:10:03.320 --> 01:10:04.930
pitch, pitch variation,

01:10:04.930 --> 01:10:06.310
note events, and time.

01:10:06.310 --> 01:10:07.680
Pitch is represented by cents,

01:10:07.680 --> 01:10:10.180
and duration is—again—relative.

01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:12.330
By being this technical and literal,

01:10:12.330 --> 01:10:15.010
it aims to be able to notate
music from all cultures.

01:10:15.010 --> 01:10:17.700
It was initially proposed as
a new way to write music,

01:10:17.700 --> 01:10:20.970
accompanied by the boilerplate
notation whinge you come to expect.

01:10:21.210 --> 01:10:22.910
However, from a performer’s point of view,

01:10:22.910 --> 01:10:26.540
it is far less legible than many similar
proposals we’ve already looked at.

01:10:26.540 --> 01:10:28.430
One particularly awkward thing about it

01:10:28.430 --> 01:10:31.760
is how the staff lines change
depending on the pitch ranges used,

01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:33.980
which means the performer
can never rely on memory

01:10:33.980 --> 01:10:36.770
to know what these lines
mean in any given piece.

01:10:36.770 --> 01:10:39.510
So they’d have to constantly reference
the cent numbers on the left

01:10:39.510 --> 01:10:41.470
to know what pitch
they’re supposed to play.

01:10:41.470 --> 01:10:43.780
Also, there’s a weirdness
in its basic premise.

01:10:43.780 --> 01:10:46.710
If it’s supposed to represent
what the listener actually hears,

01:10:46.710 --> 01:10:48.660
then the performance must
have already happened,

01:10:48.660 --> 01:10:52.140
so it seems to me to be more of an
aid to an existing audio recording

01:10:52.140 --> 01:10:54.920
rather than an instruction on
how to perform in the first place.

01:10:55.190 --> 01:10:57.410
The goals of Global Notation
have narrowed since.

01:10:57.410 --> 01:10:58.680
As of 2021,

01:10:58.680 --> 01:11:00.660
its stated purpose is purely academic—

01:11:00.660 --> 01:11:03.390
a tool to be used in the analysis
of non-Western music.

01:11:03.700 --> 01:11:06.820
Certainly, there are many cases
where standard notation is insufficient—

01:11:06.820 --> 01:11:08.860
like in describing micro-variant textures

01:11:08.860 --> 01:11:10.960
found in Carnatic music, for example.

01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:13.810
So Global Notation is certainly
a sensible proposal.

01:11:13.810 --> 01:11:17.060
Whether it will be successful as a
system used in ethnomusicology

01:11:17.060 --> 01:11:18.310
remains to be seen.

01:11:19.020 --> 01:11:20.900
Jianpu is a straightforward system

01:11:20.900 --> 01:11:23.720
used successfully in
early-stage learning in China.

01:11:23.720 --> 01:11:26.400
It’s essentially a variation of
the tonic sol-fa system,

01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:28.590
where Do, Re, Mi, Fa, Sol, La, Ti

01:11:28.590 --> 01:11:29.860
are replaced by numbers.

01:11:29.860 --> 01:11:31.460
Dots are placed above or below

01:11:31.460 --> 01:11:34.190
to indicate whether the octave
should be higher or lower.

01:11:34.190 --> 01:11:36.790
Although it superficially looks
similar to Carrillo’s system,

01:11:36.790 --> 01:11:38.040
it is completely different.

01:11:38.040 --> 01:11:39.430
More suitable for basic music,

01:11:39.430 --> 01:11:41.790
with obvious limitations
once you go beyond that.

01:11:41.790 --> 01:11:43.590
However, it’s really popular in China,

01:11:43.590 --> 01:11:45.360
so worthy of a deeper investigation

01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:46.890
as a potential early aide.

01:11:54.650 --> 01:11:56.380
So, after all of this investigating—

01:11:56.380 --> 01:11:58.090
what conclusions can we come to?

01:11:58.090 --> 01:11:59.490
Well, before I get to that,

01:11:59.490 --> 01:12:01.430
I just want to talk about
this channel for a second.

01:12:01.730 --> 01:12:03.120
If you’ve been with me for a while,

01:12:03.120 --> 01:12:04.570
you’ll notice that my work is both

01:12:04.570 --> 01:12:06.540
research-heavy and production-heavy,

01:12:06.540 --> 01:12:08.940
meaning I only get a
few videos out each year.

01:12:08.940 --> 01:12:10.960
If this is something you’re
interested in supporting,

01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:12.260
there are two ways you can do it:

01:12:12.260 --> 01:12:13.160
via Patreon

01:12:13.160 --> 01:12:15.910
or by watching my content on
the streaming service Nebula,

01:12:15.910 --> 01:12:18.230
where I’m joined by other
high-quality creators like

01:12:18.230 --> 01:12:19.140
HBomberguy,

01:12:19.140 --> 01:12:19.820
Adam Neely,

01:12:19.820 --> 01:12:20.680
Mary Spender

01:12:20.680 --> 01:12:21.740
and Aimee Nolte.

01:12:21.740 --> 01:12:23.830
With Patreon, you
generally get more stuff:

01:12:23.830 --> 01:12:26.060
updates, sneak peeks, Q&A sessions

01:12:26.060 --> 01:12:28.328
and the occasional video
about my processes.

01:12:28.330 --> 01:12:30.110
However, with both Nebula and Patreon,

01:12:30.110 --> 01:12:33.190
you can see videos of mine that are
no longer available on YouTube

01:12:33.190 --> 01:12:35.090
due to Eurovision TV,

01:12:35.090 --> 01:12:37.450
who didn’t like me making fun
of them a few years ago.

01:12:37.450 --> 01:12:39.590
That's right, I have two
Eurovision videos.

01:12:39.590 --> 01:12:42.270
The second one, in particular,
is an all-time favourite of mine—

01:12:42.270 --> 01:12:45.410
where I look at the musical and lyrical
ingredients of a Eurovision song

01:12:45.410 --> 01:12:48.280
and use them to create a complete
atrocity of my very own.

01:12:48.280 --> 01:12:49.680
It was my first hit on YouTube.

01:12:53.020 --> 01:12:54.770
Since it’s clear that I
haven’t found a system

01:12:54.770 --> 01:12:56.860
I believe should replace
standard notation,

01:12:56.860 --> 01:12:59.890
do we really have to just accept
that things should never change?

01:13:00.270 --> 01:13:01.270
Well, no.

01:13:01.270 --> 01:13:02.430
As we’ve seen earlier,

01:13:02.430 --> 01:13:04.950
the development of notation
happened very slowly

01:13:04.950 --> 01:13:06.550
for around 600 years,

01:13:06.550 --> 01:13:08.700
but it didn’t stop 2 or 3 centuries ago.

01:13:08.700 --> 01:13:10.820
Various changes still slowly happen,

01:13:10.820 --> 01:13:12.550
with older, more ornate systems

01:13:12.550 --> 01:13:14.280
gradually becoming simplified.

01:13:14.280 --> 01:13:15.750
Now, in the 20th century,

01:13:15.750 --> 01:13:18.490
there was an explosion of
adapted notation systems,

01:13:18.490 --> 01:13:20.900
created to accommodate
different types of music.

01:13:20.900 --> 01:13:22.170
Microtonal music,

01:13:22.170 --> 01:13:25.380
free-metered music, and aleatoric
music particularly stand out.

01:13:25.380 --> 01:13:29.140
I created a video about aleatoricism
a few years ago, if you’re interested.

01:13:29.140 --> 01:13:31.470
There are also all kinds
of bespoke scores—

01:13:31.470 --> 01:13:34.050
like those created by
Karlheinz Stockhausen,

01:13:34.050 --> 01:13:36.090
which combined elements
of standard notation

01:13:36.090 --> 01:13:38.090
with different types of
graphic visualisation

01:13:38.090 --> 01:13:40.270
to achieve specific musical effects.

01:13:40.710 --> 01:13:42.890
In these scores, you can
often spot many ideas

01:13:42.890 --> 01:13:45.590
from some of the proposals
we've looked at in this video.

01:13:45.590 --> 01:13:48.270
There are also many kinds
of abstract notation too,

01:13:48.270 --> 01:13:50.840
which introduce varying
degrees of ambiguity

01:13:50.840 --> 01:13:53.250
to prompt novel types
of musical performance.

01:13:53.250 --> 01:13:55.490
Some scores are works of
art in their own right.

01:13:55.490 --> 01:13:58.130
However, the move to digital
around the 80s and 90s

01:13:58.130 --> 01:13:59.690
was slow and clunky—

01:13:59.690 --> 01:14:01.230
and I also feel it contributed to

01:14:01.230 --> 01:14:03.470
halting some of these
20th-century developments,

01:14:03.470 --> 01:14:04.980
since digital applications

01:14:04.980 --> 01:14:07.400
simply couldn’t accommodate
much experimentation.

01:14:07.400 --> 01:14:09.070
This is true even today.

01:14:09.070 --> 01:14:11.130
However, digital apps will catch up,

01:14:11.130 --> 01:14:13.020
broadening the possibilities
for what you can do

01:14:13.020 --> 01:14:14.500
by just being more flexible.

01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:16.180
And related to this point,

01:14:16.180 --> 01:14:17.840
let me jump into MuseScore to show you

01:14:17.840 --> 01:14:19.610
some of the things it can currently do.

01:14:19.610 --> 01:14:21.930
Here, I’m looking at a
standard notation view.

01:14:21.930 --> 01:14:23.380
But if I make one little change.

01:14:23.380 --> 01:14:26.250
The same data is now
displayed as guitar tab instead.

01:14:26.250 --> 01:14:28.350
I can also switch it to coloured notation.

01:14:28.350 --> 01:14:30.340
I can switch it to solfege noteheads.

01:14:30.340 --> 01:14:31.490
Just a few months ago,

01:14:31.490 --> 01:14:33.710
we released a version that
works with Braille readers,

01:14:33.710 --> 01:14:36.860
and we’re currently developing
the ability to display Jianpu.

01:14:36.860 --> 01:14:38.890
The data is the same
for all these formats,

01:14:38.890 --> 01:14:40.580
so switching between them is easy.

01:14:40.580 --> 01:14:42.560
So what’s needed now is further expansion

01:14:42.560 --> 01:14:45.230
to accommodate more
systems and more flexibility.

01:14:45.230 --> 01:14:47.400
And this is where I think the
change needs to happen:

01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:49.820
we need to move to a
completely digital format.

01:14:49.820 --> 01:14:51.770
A format which, unlike PDF,

01:14:51.770 --> 01:14:54.220
retains and understands musical data.

01:14:54.220 --> 01:14:55.290
When that happens,

01:14:55.290 --> 01:14:57.260
musicians can choose
whatever format they want.

01:14:57.260 --> 01:14:58.540
Chromatic staves,

01:14:58.540 --> 01:15:00.150
systems with relative durations,

01:15:00.150 --> 01:15:01.280
coloured notation,

01:15:01.280 --> 01:15:02.180
a piano roll,

01:15:02.180 --> 01:15:03.220
Klavarskribo,

01:15:03.220 --> 01:15:03.810
Jianpu.

01:15:03.810 --> 01:15:04.960
The list goes on.

01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:06.730
The next logical step beyond that

01:15:06.730 --> 01:15:10.280
would see this format applied to
digitised theory textbooks too.

01:15:10.540 --> 01:15:13.650
This would weaken the need to
agree on one unchanging system.

01:15:13.650 --> 01:15:16.100
And the price of introducing
changes would be much lower

01:15:16.100 --> 01:15:19.550
because digital textbooks wouldn’t need
to be rewritten to accommodate them.

01:15:19.550 --> 01:15:21.200
You’d just add the latest standard.

01:15:21.710 --> 01:15:23.060
Now, all that aside,

01:15:23.060 --> 01:15:24.880
if you are not a person
who reads notation,

01:15:24.880 --> 01:15:26.880
I hope I’ve successfully demonstrated

01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:28.120
that it is not something dead,

01:15:28.120 --> 01:15:29.860
which belongs to a bygone era.

01:15:29.860 --> 01:15:33.050
It’s a living, breathing system
that belongs to us, now.

01:15:33.050 --> 01:15:35.410
It’s also frankly nowhere
near as hard to learn

01:15:35.410 --> 01:15:36.670
as some would have you believe,

01:15:36.670 --> 01:15:39.230
and learning it has
enormously benefited my life.

01:15:39.470 --> 01:15:41.410
Despite its flaws and compromises,

01:15:41.410 --> 01:15:44.330
standard notation is a
remarkable cultural achievement,

01:15:44.330 --> 01:15:45.930
universal for all instruments

01:15:45.930 --> 01:15:48.250
and which transcends
spoken language barriers.

01:15:48.480 --> 01:15:49.450
A system that—

01:15:49.450 --> 01:15:52.730
just like the mediaeval chess game
we saw at the beginning of this video—

01:15:52.730 --> 01:15:54.670
allows us to reach into the past

01:15:54.670 --> 01:15:56.730
to understand the ideas of our ancestors.

01:15:56.730 --> 01:15:59.530
A direct link to our history
that’s incredibly valuable

01:15:59.530 --> 01:16:00.900
and worth preserving.

01:16:01.180 --> 01:16:03.700
Notation will continue to
change over the centuries

01:16:03.700 --> 01:16:04.890
and, for my money,

01:16:04.890 --> 01:16:07.110
won’t be dying any time soon.

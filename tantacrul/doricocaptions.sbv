0:00:02.520,0:00:03.940
No matter your profession,

0:00:03.940,0:00:08.220
...learning to use a new application to
do your job can be a painful experience.

0:00:08.520,0:00:12.700
Yes, the software you’re currently using
has all kinds of weird quirks and problems,

0:00:12.700,0:00:14.920
...especially if it’s PowerPoint or Dreamweaver.

0:00:14.920,0:00:16.980
Man, have you ever used Dreamweaver?

0:00:16.980,0:00:17.920
It’s awful.

0:00:17.920,0:00:19.060
It’s just awful.

0:00:19.060,0:00:21.740
But the thing about these problems is that, over time,

0:00:21.740,0:00:23.100
...you learn to overcome them,

0:00:23.100,0:00:25.860
...and eventually, you develop quite a bit of speed.

0:00:25.860,0:00:27.000
Things are fine.

0:00:27.000,0:00:28.940
You can work well enough with what you have,

0:00:28.940,0:00:30.940
..and yes, some of it is a little annoying,

0:00:30.940,0:00:32.400
...but life's not perfect.

0:00:32.400,0:00:33.100
And then along,

0:00:33.100,0:00:36.020
...comes some game changer that
everyone keeps talking about.

0:00:43.040,0:00:45.800
Now, if the app is Dreamweaver,
those people have a point.

0:00:45.800,0:00:48.120
I just can’t stress how much I hate Dreamweaver.

0:00:48.120,0:00:52.440
But often the process of moving to
the new thing is really, really painful,

0:00:52.440,0:00:55.540
...and you just end up with a whole
bunch of new problems to overcome.

0:00:55.540,0:00:57.660
This all boils down to one question:

0:01:02.040,0:01:03.960
Uh, it’s a two-part question.

0:01:03.960,0:01:05.560
Now, in the world of composition,

0:01:05.560,0:01:07.520
...the industry leader, Sibelius,

0:01:07.520,0:01:09.480
...is the ultimate trial by fire.

0:01:09.480,0:01:13.860
Understanding it is a bit like learning to
drive a new route to work while blindfolded.

0:01:13.860,0:01:16.340
Your experience and intuition aren't gonna help you.

0:01:16.340,0:01:21.560
Instead, you need to rely on brute-force trial-and-error
by simply crashing into everything around you

0:01:21.560,0:01:24.820
...in order to piece together a mental
construct of what’s going on,

0:01:24.820,0:01:28.400
...with your primary guides being
abstract causality and pain.

0:01:28.820,0:01:30.660
It should be renamed 'Pavlovius'.

0:01:30.900,0:01:35.700
So, for all of us who’ve had to endure the
process of divining the mechanics of Sibelius,

0:01:35.700,0:01:37.240
...we don’t want to do it again.

0:01:37.240,0:01:38.460
We’re survivors.

0:01:38.460,0:01:39.840
Yeah, it’s a nightmare to learn.

0:01:39.840,0:01:41.400
It took me years to get good at it.

0:01:41.400,0:01:43.460
But, despite the awful interface,

0:01:43.460,0:01:46.220
...it is actually quite powerful, and eventually,

0:01:46.220,0:01:47.320
...EVENTUALLY,

0:01:47.320,0:01:49.180
...you get to be pretty quick at it too.

0:01:49.620,0:01:50.320
It's fine.

0:01:50.520,0:01:51.220
Leave it.

0:01:51.560,0:01:52.380
It’s fine.

0:01:53.360,0:01:54.400
But it’s not fine.

0:01:55.420,0:01:56.540
Not anymore,

0:01:56.540,0:01:58.840
...because there’s a new app on the scene.

0:01:58.840,0:02:02.680
A direct competitor hell-bent on
running those Sibelius folk out of...

0:02:02.680,0:02:03.400
...town...

0:02:06.540,0:02:07.300
Who are you?

0:02:07.480,0:02:08.700
'I’m Jankman!'

0:02:08.700,0:02:11.340
'And you’re going to be seeing me a little later!'

0:02:29.280,0:02:29.840
'Hello everybody,

0:02:29.840,0:02:33.720
...and thank you for tuning into
today's, uh, livestream about Dorico 3.'

0:02:35.220,0:02:36.980
This is Daniel Spreadbury.

0:02:36.980,0:02:39.220
He’s pretty much the spokesperson of Dorico.

0:02:39.480,0:02:42.620
And to begin looking at what he
and the rest of his team have built,

0:02:42.620,0:02:45.220
...let’s go back a few years to 2012,

0:02:45.220,0:02:48.900
...when the majority of that team were
working on a different notation app called,

0:02:48.900,0:02:49.660
...um,

0:02:50.060,0:02:51.400
...Sibelius.

0:02:52.440,0:02:54.760
Right, I’ve already spoken about this once before,

0:02:54.760,0:02:56.460
...so let’s recap quickly.

0:02:56.460,0:03:00.500
Sibelius was bought by a multimedia
company called AVID in 2006.

0:03:00.500,0:03:05.240
Daniel Spreadbury and the rest of the Sibelius team
were based in Finsbury Park in London at the time.

0:03:05.240,0:03:07.380
But a few years after they purchased Sibelius,

0:03:07.380,0:03:08.900
...AVID ran into some financial trouble,

0:03:08.900,0:03:12.060
...with their share price tanking at the end of 2011.

0:03:12.060,0:03:14.640
So, as part of an emergency cost-saving measure,

0:03:14.640,0:03:16.900
...they decided to let the Finsbury Park team go,

0:03:16.900,0:03:20.200
...and began recruiting a new and
much cheaper team in the Ukraine.

0:03:20.200,0:03:24.020
Then, three years later, the Ukraine team
seems to have not worked out,

0:03:24.020,0:03:27.980
...and Sibelius started advertising for yet
another development team in Montreal.

0:03:27.980,0:03:31.420
As Tim Carrol, AVID’s vice president
for audio products, explained:

0:03:42.040,0:03:43.440
...or to put it another way,

0:03:43.440,0:03:45.660
'It turns out we needed the people we fired.'

0:03:45.900,0:03:48.020
The closing of the Finsbury Park office

0:03:48.020,0:03:50.980
...caught the attention of Yamaha,
who saw an opportunity.

0:03:50.980,0:03:54.240
You see: AVID’s revenue has been
slowly declining for years now,

0:03:54.240,0:03:55.820
...with its two other money makers

0:03:55.820,0:03:57.580
Pro Tools and Media Composer

0:03:57.580,0:04:00.020
...facing increasingly stiff competition.

0:04:00.020,0:04:01.500
Sibelius, on the other hand,

0:04:01.500,0:04:04.360
...is still solidly the industry standard for notation,

0:04:04.360,0:04:07.380
...and has a pretty firm footing
in the education space too,

0:04:07.380,0:04:09.360
...which makes it difficult to displace.

0:04:09.360,0:04:11.240
And since it integrates with Pro Tools,

0:04:11.240,0:04:14.320
...it’s attractive to those who
write music for movies and TV,

0:04:14.320,0:04:17.540
...or who want to convert their scores
into highly-produced audio tracks.

0:04:17.540,0:04:21.180
However, for those bought into the
Sibelius/Pro Tools ecosystem,

0:04:21.180,0:04:22.860
...there is some cause for concern:

0:04:22.860,0:04:25.640
Are AVID destined to continue this trajectory of decline?

0:04:25.640,0:04:29.800
And, if so, given that they were willing to
massively halt Sibelius’ development once,

0:04:29.800,0:04:31.180
...would they do it again?

0:04:31.180,0:04:32.840
Is Sibelius safe?

0:04:32.840,0:04:35.440
Well, Yamaha are also asking these questions.

0:04:35.440,0:04:37.180
They own a company called Steinberg,

0:04:37.180,0:04:40.620
...who in turn own Cubase, a
direct competitor to Pro Tools.

0:04:40.620,0:04:44.340
And since they’re obviously always
looking for a way to give Cubase an edge,

0:04:44.340,0:04:47.980
...when AVID decided to ditch
the Finsbury Park team in 2012,

0:04:47.980,0:04:49.420
...they saw an opportunity.

0:04:49.420,0:04:50.960
Here, offered up on a platter,

0:04:50.960,0:04:54.700
...was a group of people with the experience
to develop a rival notation program

0:04:54.700,0:04:56.180
...which could integrate with Cubase,

0:04:56.180,0:04:59.440
...and, together, could be poised to
step in as the new industry standard

0:04:59.440,0:05:01.860
...if AVID's fortunes continued to deteriorate.

0:05:02.160,0:05:04.960
Dorico was never going to suddenly
take over from Sibelius.

0:05:04.960,0:05:07.520
No, there’s a longer game being played here.

0:05:08.460,0:05:09.940
So, before we go any further,

0:05:09.940,0:05:13.660
...you might be wondering why I’ve not yet
mentioned the other two major notation apps,

0:05:13.660,0:05:15.000
...Finale and Musescore?

0:05:15.000,0:05:16.720
Well, with regards to Finale,

0:05:16.720,0:05:18.780
...which is still Sibelius’ main rival,

0:05:18.780,0:05:19.940
...I’m saving it for last,

0:05:19.940,0:05:22.480
...and I don’t want to give the game
away by talking about it now.

0:05:22.720,0:05:24.500
Regarding Musescore, well,

0:05:24.500,0:05:26.380
...that’s bit more of an interesting one actually.

0:05:26.380,0:05:30.020
And if you haven’t already heard the news
about this, I guess you’ll be pretty surprised.

0:05:30.360,0:05:34.480
So, after I created my video about
Musescore in March 2019,

0:05:34.480,0:05:38.180
...the open-source community set about
fixing all the issues I had mentioned.

0:05:38.180,0:05:40.000
I was quite impressed and honored by this,

0:05:40.000,0:05:44.940
...and over time, I found myself regularly talking
to them about the specifics of certain fixes.

0:05:44.940,0:05:47.740
Eventually, I started submitting proper designs too.

0:05:47.740,0:05:51.280
And as I got more involved, I discovered
that I got along really well with the team,

0:05:51.280,0:05:53.080
...so one thing led to another.

0:05:53.080,0:05:54.700
We started holding hands,

0:05:54.700,0:05:56.000
...we dated for a while,

0:05:56.000,0:05:58.240
...and on 5th November 2019,

0:05:58.240,0:05:59.820
...finally decided to tie the knot

0:05:59.820,0:06:02.440
...and I became MuseScore’s new Head of Design.

0:06:02.440,0:06:03.300
I know.

0:06:03.300,0:06:04.220
What a match!

0:06:04.560,0:06:07.380
So now that I’m now actively working
on the design of MuseScore,

0:06:07.380,0:06:10.700
...I feel there are two obvious 
questions I should quickly address.

0:06:10.700,0:06:13.240
First, what does this mean for the Tantacrul channel?

0:06:13.240,0:06:15.520
Well, in terms of output, nothing.

0:06:15.520,0:06:18.340
If I do cover my work on MuseScore here in the future,

0:06:18.340,0:06:21.940
...it’ll only be when I think the subject is
interesting enough for a general audience,

0:06:21.940,0:06:26.480
...and I’ll largely be documenting my design
work over on the MuseScore channel instead.

0:06:26.480,0:06:29.160
So, for anyone interested in following that progress,

0:06:29.160,0:06:30.440
...the link is in the description.

0:06:31.360,0:06:33.460
The second question that I imagine this will raise

0:06:33.460,0:06:38.640
...is whether or not my involvement with Musescore
will bias my appraisal of Dorico or Finale.

0:06:38.640,0:06:40.140
I mean, it’s a fair question,

0:06:40.140,0:06:42.900
...and it’s probably worth describing
my own motivations here.

0:06:43.220,0:06:46.120
I joined Musescore so I could put
my money where my mouth is:

0:06:46.120,0:06:48.820
To design a notation app to be
the way I think it should be,

0:06:48.820,0:06:51.220
...and the last thing I want to do in pursuit of that goal

0:06:51.220,0:06:54.960
...is to start engaging in cringeworthy
‘Us and Them’ corporate tribalism,

0:06:54.960,0:06:56.540
...of the Steve Ballmer variety.

0:06:56.660,0:07:00.180
'Steve Jobs goes to MacWorld 
and he pulls out this iPhone.'

0:07:00.180,0:07:02.000
'What was your first reaction when you saw that?'

0:07:03.500,0:07:06.900
'500 dollars? Fully subsidized? With a plan?'

0:07:06.900,0:07:09.940
'I said that is the most expensive phone in the world.'

0:07:09.940,0:07:13.720
'And it doesn’t appeal to business customers
because it doesn’t have a keyboard,'

0:07:13.720,0:07:16.020
'...which makes it not a very good email machine.'

0:07:16.020,0:07:18.800
If I start failing to recognise the
good work of those around me,

0:07:18.800,0:07:20.160
...how good is my work gonna be?

0:07:20.160,0:07:22.720
So, I’m going to proceed exactly as I have before:

0:07:22.720,0:07:24.880
When I see something I like, I’ll say so.

0:07:24.880,0:07:26.340
And when I see something janky,

0:07:26.340,0:07:28.540
...I‘m going to mercilessly mock it, as always.

0:07:28.540,0:07:32.780
And as you watch this video, you can judge for
yourselves whether you think I’m being fair or not.

0:07:32.780,0:07:35.200
And with all that said, let’s get back into it.

0:07:36.680,0:07:40.720
The Dorico team have a tendency to irritate
those who currently work on Sibelius,

0:07:40.720,0:07:42.160
...and it's not hard to see why.

0:07:42.160,0:07:45.860
Nearly every article about Dorico or
interview with one of the team members

0:07:45.860,0:07:47.740
...will mention the Finsbury Park incident,

0:07:47.740,0:07:51.000
...although, to be fair, it’s hard to see
how that subject can be avoided.

0:07:51.000,0:07:52.040
But that’s not all.

0:07:52.040,0:07:56.000
'Sibelius' seems to come up a lot when team
members describe the design of Dorico too,

0:07:56.000,0:07:57.160
...with the sentiment being:

0:07:57.160,0:07:58.980
‘Look at how badly they do things!'

0:07:58.980,0:08:01.240
I’ve linked to a few examples of this in the description.

0:08:01.240,0:08:03.020
The funny thing about this though is that,

0:08:03.020,0:08:05.340
...since they ARE the old Sibelius team,

0:08:05.340,0:08:08.740
...then they’re to a significant degree
responsible for this badness,

0:08:08.740,0:08:09.720
Bear in mind, by the way,

0:08:09.720,0:08:13.340
...that this is the team who brought us
the awful ribbon design with Sibelius 7,

0:08:13.340,0:08:17.080
...a legacy that the current Sibelius
team are rather unfairly saddled with.

0:08:17.080,0:08:19.900
So with that said, what is this video going to focus on?

0:08:19.900,0:08:22.900
Well, I’ve spent the last 8 months using Dorico properly.

0:08:22.900,0:08:24.920
And like my previous music software videos,

0:08:24.920,0:08:29.380
...I think it offers up a lot of interesting lessons
about the challenges of creating music software,

0:08:29.380,0:08:32.280
...and I’ve made sure to focus on
aspects I’ve not spoken about before.

0:08:32.280,0:08:36.440
For those who can’t read music, this video should
still be pretty straightforward to understand.

For those interested in my overall assessment of Dorico,

0:08:39.120,0:08:42.420
...I’m going to be putting it head-to-head
against Sibelius to see which is better.

0:08:42.420,0:08:43.800
And as I go through this video,

0:08:43.800,0:08:45.520
...I’m going to answer the crucial question:

0:08:45.520,0:08:47.380
Which would I pick to write music in?

0:08:48.480,0:08:49.820
So as I mentioned earlier,

0:08:49.820,0:08:54.920
...Dorico spends a lot of time and effort positioning
itself as a more elite notation program than Sibelius.

0:08:54.920,0:09:00.180
And they reinforce this message constantly in
interviews, tutorials, press releases and blog posts.

0:09:00.180,0:09:02.960
The look and layout of the app
tries to convey this message too,

0:09:02.960,0:09:04.320
...sometimes literally.

0:09:04.320,0:09:07.680
I mean, the very first thing you see
when you open Dorico is the tagline:

0:09:07.680,0:09:09.420
‘Advanced Music Notation System’.

0:09:10.640,0:09:12.460
The UI is dark by default,

0:09:12.460,0:09:14.260
...which reminds me of a design adage:

0:09:14.260,0:09:16.740
‘Use white if you want to look easy and non-threatening,

0:09:16.740,0:09:18.460
...use black if you want to look pro.'

0:09:18.760,0:09:21.140
They claim to be intuitive and simple to use,

0:09:21.140,0:09:24.780
...so I was curious to see what they’d done
to improve upon the Sibelius model.

0:09:24.780,0:09:25.840
And to help me answer this,

0:09:25.840,0:09:28.500
...I decided to try something I’ve
not done before on this channel.

0:09:28.500,0:09:30.020
In October 2019,

0:09:30.020,0:09:33.080
...I sent out a call on my Patreon, YouTube and Twitter,

0:09:33.080,0:09:36.220
...asking experienced musicians
to help me do some user-testing.

0:09:36.220,0:09:38.160
After receiving hundreds of responses,

0:09:38.160,0:09:41.240
...I chose 25 people who had never used Dorico before,

0:09:41.240,0:09:44.540
...and asked them to, one, download
and install the trial version,

0:09:44.540,0:09:46.640
...and, two, try writing a few bars of music

0:09:46.640,0:09:49.440
...using whatever instruments and
styles they were comfortable with.

0:09:49.440,0:09:51.540
'I am quite comfortable using Sibelius, '

0:09:51.540,0:09:53.480
'...I've never used Dorico before, '

0:09:53.480,0:09:54.820
'...though I've been really excited to try.'

0:09:54.820,0:09:58.260
'So now, again, I'm stuck at this
point where I need more bars.'

0:09:58.260,0:09:59.180
'This is killing me.''

0:09:59.180,0:10:01.540
This is the ultimate test for any application:

0:10:01.540,0:10:03.140
The first-time user test.

0:10:03.140,0:10:05.760
It doesn’t indicate how good an
app is once you’ve learned it,

0:10:05.760,0:10:07.380
...and we’ll definitely get to that later,

0:10:07.380,0:10:09.680
...but it does directly test how intuitive it is.

0:10:09.680,0:10:10.880
And for anyone interested,

0:10:10.880,0:10:13.120
...these sessions typically lasted about an hour.

0:10:13.120,0:10:15.600
So, why did I focus on this type of testing?

0:10:15.600,0:10:17.800
Well, firstly, this is a video about design,

0:10:17.800,0:10:21.420
...and I wanted to show one of the tools
designers use to validate their work.

0:10:21.420,0:10:27.120
Secondly, the first-time user test is extremely important
to pass for any app competing in a crowded market.

0:10:27.120,0:10:27.800
Why?

0:10:27.800,0:10:31.020
Well, because when people
decide to install your free trial,

0:10:31.020,0:10:32.480
...that’s your opportunity to convince them

0:10:32.480,0:10:36.480
...that it’s worth making the jump from what
they are currently using to what you are offering.

0:10:36.480,0:10:38.040
And every complication,

0:10:38.040,0:10:41.620
...every bit of jank they encounter along
the way during this crucial period

0:10:41.620,0:10:44.180
...is more likely to convince them
that it’s just not worth doing.

0:10:44.520,0:10:45.620
And in Dorico’s case,

0:10:45.620,0:10:49.060
...considering that it’s aggressively
targeting Sibelius and Finale users,

0:10:49.060,0:10:52.360
...a bad first-time experience is
really hurtful to their chances.

0:10:52.360,0:10:56.180
Also, this is the best test you can use to
determine if something is well-designed,

0:10:56.180,0:11:00.060
...because every time an app requires you to consult
the manual to figure out how to do something,

0:11:00.060,0:11:02.860
...especially when other apps
already make that thing easy,

0:11:02.860,0:11:05.120
...it's not doing a particularly good job.

0:11:05.120,0:11:09.340
Now, the experience of those I recorded largely
matched my own first-time experience,

0:11:09.340,0:11:10.840
...which is... mixed,

0:11:10.840,0:11:13.020
...and in places, pretty painful.

0:11:13.020,0:11:14.380
So, strap in people,

0:11:14.380,0:11:17.700
...because, even though there’s a
lot of good stuff to discuss later,

0:11:17.700,0:11:20.240
...we first need to talk about the setup process.

0:11:20.820,0:11:21.560
Okay.

0:11:21.860,0:11:23.240
Are you ready for the pain?

0:11:24.420,0:11:24.920
Right.

0:11:24.920,0:11:26.960
To begin using a trial of Dorico 3,

0:11:26.960,0:11:29.100
...you need to create a Steinberg ID,

0:11:29.100,0:11:30.840
...by entering your email and a password.

0:11:30.840,0:11:33.120
And right off the bat, we have a usability issue.

0:11:33.120,0:11:34.160
The title says:

0:11:36.520,0:11:39.080
And at the bottom you have what
looks like a 'Confirm' button.

0:11:39.080,0:11:41.560
Now, most people foolishly
understood this to mean that

0:11:41.560,0:11:43.080
...you should enter your email here

0:11:43.080,0:11:44.220
...and your password there

0:11:44.220,0:11:46.240
...and press ‘Create Steinberg ID’.

0:11:46.860,0:11:47.520
Lovely.

0:11:47.520,0:11:49.220
And you’ll need to fill that out again.

0:11:49.220,0:11:52.100
For what it’s worth, most participants
did this step before speaking to me,

0:11:52.100,0:11:54.000
...so I only saw it happen 4 times.

0:11:54.000,0:11:55.120
And out of those 4 times,

0:11:55.120,0:11:56.620
...3 people made this mistake.

0:11:56.980,0:11:58.120
And once you’ve registered,

0:11:58.120,0:12:00.900
...they email you a code, which
just about everyone copies.

0:12:02.740,0:12:04.980
"I cannot... paste in here?"

0:12:04.980,0:12:07.660
Then, after hitting the redundant 'Continue' button,

0:12:07.660,0:12:09.460
...you are taken to this doozy:

0:12:11.720,0:12:13.140
...with the following options:

0:12:14.860,0:12:17.660
Watching people encountering
this step was pretty amusing.

0:12:17.660,0:12:19.100
"What?"

0:12:19.500,0:12:21.060
"The- There's no choice."

0:12:21.060,0:12:23.560
"What kind of trial is this?"

0:12:23.560,0:12:26.040
"It just rubs me the wrong way, there's just- this thing,"

0:12:26.040,0:12:27.080
"I'm not a fan,"

0:12:27.080,0:12:29.320
"...because that'd be- the first thing
I'm gonna do is unsubscribe."

0:12:29.560,0:12:31.100
Then they send you an activation code,

0:12:31.100,0:12:33.040
...which contains hidden curse words,

0:12:33.040,0:12:34.700
...and you also get your download link.

0:12:36.440,0:12:39.800
I should probably tell you at this point that
you are nowhere near 'one step away',

0:12:39.800,0:12:41.680
...you’re like 20% way through this.

0:12:41.940,0:12:44.640
So, the download link doesn’t actually download Dorico.

0:12:44.640,0:12:47.100
Instead, you get the ‘Steinberg Download Assistant’,

0:12:47.100,0:12:50.100
...a landing page that finally
allows you to download Dorico,

0:12:50.100,0:12:52.440
...along with the orchestral libraries that come with it.

0:12:52.440,0:12:54.040
And when installing the download assistant,

0:12:54.040,0:12:56.400
...it asks you whether you want
to install something called

0:12:56.400,0:12:58.280
...the ‘aria2 download manager’,

0:12:58.280,0:13:01.880
...a download manager which they explain
makes your download assistant work better.

0:13:01.880,0:13:03.560
Anyway, once that’s all set up,

0:13:03.560,0:13:06.060
...you can finally click on Dorico 3 to download it.

0:13:06.480,0:13:09.500
Once installed, you click on the Dorico icon to open it,

0:13:09.500,0:13:10.340
...and it tells you:

0:13:10.340,0:13:11.760
'No license found',

0:13:11.760,0:13:13.780
...which is one of those messages that makes you think,

0:13:13.780,0:13:15.260
‘Oh no, I’ve done something wrong!'

0:13:21.300,0:13:23.220
And there’s a button, which, when pressed,

0:13:23.220,0:13:25.620
...opens a program called the ‘eLicenser’,

0:13:25.620,0:13:28.340
...which it turns out they installed on
your machine without telling you.

0:13:28.340,0:13:32.440
And if you’re on Windows, they also
auto-created a desktop shortcut too.

0:13:32.440,0:13:33.520
Uh, okay.

0:13:33.520,0:13:35.960
Looks like you got some spring cleaning to do after this!

0:13:35.960,0:13:37.500
So, you go back to your email,

0:13:37.500,0:13:39.700
...grab your activation code and enter it,

0:13:39.700,0:13:41.200
...then you press 'Activate License',

0:13:41.200,0:13:44.280
...only to be told that the eLicenser is out of date.

0:13:44.800,0:13:45.360
What!?

0:13:45.360,0:13:47.540
But, h- hold on. I just installed it?

0:13:47.540,0:13:49.000
How did I mess this up?

0:13:49.000,0:13:51.280
Now, a few people didn’t know what to do at this point

0:13:51.280,0:13:55.700
...and it’s worth mentioning that this was
experienced universally by every person I spoke to.

0:13:55.700,0:13:57.580
And it took some of them a long time to realise

0:13:57.580,0:13:59.360
...that the only solution to this problem

0:13:59.360,0:14:02.120
...is to follow the address mentioned
in the error message here:

0:14:04.540,0:14:06.000
And they don’t even make it a link.

0:14:06.000,0:14:07.220
It'd be nice, you know?

0:14:07.220,0:14:09.080
If there was a link so I don’t have to type it out.

0:14:09.620,0:14:12.540
So, then you download the
latest version of the eLicenser,

0:14:12.540,0:14:14.960
(thanks for nothing, Steinberg Download Assistant!)

0:14:14.960,0:14:16.500
...and then you install it, and...

0:14:16.500,0:14:17.680
Oh, what now?

0:14:26.580,0:14:29.340
So, guess which application is causing the issue?

0:14:29.340,0:14:30.120
That’s right,

0:14:30.120,0:14:31.260
...it’s Dorico.

0:14:31.260,0:14:35.560
The program that launched the eLicenser in the
first place is now preventing it from working.

0:14:35.840,0:14:37.580
What’s the opposite of 'seamless'?

0:14:38.060,0:14:39.300
'Seamful'?

0:14:40.620,0:14:42.440
Okay, so that was a trainwreck.

0:14:42.440,0:14:46.120
At this point, I should mention that
I started off interviewing 28 people,

0:14:46.120,0:14:50.200
...and 3 of them dropped out specifically because
this installation was too awkward for them.

0:14:50.200,0:14:53.880
Of the 25 remaining people, only
3 described it as straight-forward.

0:14:53.880,0:14:57.080
Okay, to be fair, this is the Steinberg
team in Hamburg’s doing,

0:14:57.080,0:14:58.900
...not the Dorico team in London.

0:14:58.900,0:15:01.400
At the moment, this tacked-together series of mishaps

0:15:01.400,0:15:03.860
...is hobbling the first-time experience of Dorico.

0:15:03.860,0:15:07.020
Anyway, let’s leave all that behind and open Dorico, uh-

0:15:08.460,0:15:11.000
...and we're brought to the Steinberg hub, which is...

0:15:11.000,0:15:11.700
...fine.

0:15:11.700,0:15:13.320
A bit disorganised and fugly.

0:15:13.320,0:15:16.460
I particularly love this vile green button over here.

0:15:16.460,0:15:18.040
This is a classic UI trick:

0:15:18.040,0:15:19.900
If people don’t notice an important button,

0:15:19.900,0:15:21.340
...just make it more horrible!

0:15:21.340,0:15:23.100
And Dorico, c- can we talk-

0:15:23.100,0:15:24.520
Can we talk about this?

0:15:24.520,0:15:25.600
Coldplay?

0:15:25.600,0:15:28.240
You’re angling to be the
creme-de-la-creme of notation apps,

0:15:28.240,0:15:30.120
...and you’re leading with Coldplay?

0:15:30.120,0:15:31.620
Oh, and it's that song:

0:15:32.480,0:15:34.500
...the one where they discovered arpeggios.

0:15:34.500,0:15:36.060
Who is your audience for this?

0:15:36.060,0:15:38.080
I mean, if you had a pop song by, I don't know,

0:15:38.080,0:15:39.100
...David Bowie,

0:15:39.100,0:15:41.240
(let’s just create a little Venn diagram here)

0:15:41.240,0:15:44.320
...I can see there being a lot of
crossover with Dorico users.

0:15:44.320,0:15:45.860
But if we were to change it to:

0:15:48.580,0:15:49.160
...and:

0:15:50.660,0:15:51.560
I think, uh-

0:15:51.560,0:15:52.760
...let’s just push those out a bit.

0:15:53.160,0:15:54.860
Yeah, well, that feels about right.

0:15:55.120,0:15:56.000
Coldplay.

0:15:56.000,0:15:56.860
Seriously.

0:15:56.860,0:15:58.660
You may as well as led with 'Chocolate Rain'.

0:15:59.360,0:16:00.580
But all that aside,

0:16:00.580,0:16:02.460
...now at least, we’re in Dorico,

0:16:02.460,0:16:04.740
...although we’re still not really done with the installation

0:16:04.740,0:16:07.200
...because next comes the audio setup.

0:16:07.200,0:16:10.060
Now, like many other composers
who write for live ensembles,

0:16:10.060,0:16:13.280
...I’m a diehard fan of the orchestral
emulator ‘NotePerformer’,

0:16:13.280,0:16:14.780
...which I could go on about at length.

0:16:15.140,0:16:20.080
NotePerformer can be easily set up as the
default sound library in both Sibelius and Finale.

0:16:20.080,0:16:21.860
But with Dorico, it’s a different story.

0:16:22.140,0:16:23.960
So, first you go to the Play category,

0:16:23.960,0:16:27.680
...and press this '+' button under
the empty 'VST Instruments' panel.

0:16:27.680,0:16:29.820
Then I can pick 'NotePerformer' from the dropdown,

0:16:29.820,0:16:33.860
...which in turn triggers a pop-up that’s been
built specifically to explain what to do,

0:16:33.860,0:16:35.880
...because there’s no way you’d ever figure it out.

0:16:36.280,0:16:37.820
So, I have to go to ‘Play’

0:16:37.820,0:16:40.260
...and choose 'NotePerformer'
from the Playback Template.

0:16:41.440,0:16:43.000
And what’s this hieroglyphic?

0:16:43.000,0:16:44.700
Is it a... sound wave or something?

0:16:46.840,0:16:48.340
That’s meant to be a factory?

0:16:48.340,0:16:51.820
‘Hey guys, the deadline is today and
we need a factory icon pronto!'

0:16:51.820,0:16:52.720
yeh, no problem

0:16:52.720,0:16:53.660
livid to me

0:16:53.660,0:16:54.540
i’ll just make the dor

0:16:54.540,0:16:55.840
and the two tings and

0:16:56.060,0:16:56.820
and de thing and

0:16:56.940,0:16:57.500
and ant

0:16:57.660,0:16:58.160
and

0:16:59.380,0:17:03.660
Next, I have to go to a completely different
place to make that template work by default.

0:17:03.660,0:17:06.120
Even then, if you press 'Play' it might not work,

0:17:06.120,0:17:09.720
...so it tells you specifically that you
have to rewind it to the beginning first,

0:17:09.720,0:17:10.820
...and then press 'Play'.

0:17:10.820,0:17:13.120
This is a novel way to fix usability bugs.

0:17:13.120,0:17:16.940
Just don’t fix them, and provide an inbuilt
pop-up that tells you how to work around it.

0:17:16.940,0:17:20.720
By the way, I’m making this seem way more
straightforward and linear than it was.

0:17:20.720,0:17:22.740
I spent a lot of time working all these out,

0:17:22.740,0:17:24.700
...especially because the ‘Play’ option up here

0:17:24.700,0:17:27.200
...is only available when you’re in the ‘Play’ category.

0:17:27.200,0:17:29.500
A really opaque clutter-saving technique.

0:17:29.820,0:17:31.580
So what would be the ideal here?

0:17:31.580,0:17:33.400
Well, how about when Dorico is opened,

0:17:33.400,0:17:34.680
...it searches for NotePerformer,

0:17:34.680,0:17:37.020
...and if it finds it, it triggers the following pop-up:

0:17:41.120,0:17:44.900
...and then simply provide them with an
option to set it as the default right there too.

0:17:44.900,0:17:46.660
And as for that last step,

0:17:46.660,0:17:49.260
...the one where I have to rewind to the start first?

0:17:49.260,0:17:51.040
Since none of the competition does that,

0:17:51.040,0:17:54.720
...I think Dorico should fix whatever they
need to fix to stop that from happening.

0:17:54.720,0:17:56.580
They can’t claim to be an intuitive app

0:17:56.580,0:18:00.060
...if they require four steps to do
what Sibelius can accomplish in one.

0:18:00.400,0:18:01.760
And just to finish up with this,

0:18:01.760,0:18:03.820
...for anyone thinking of installing the trial version,

0:18:03.820,0:18:06.040
...I should probably issue these two warnings.

0:18:06.040,0:18:09.640
First, Dorico by default likes
to hog all the audio for itself,

0:18:09.640,0:18:12.300
...preventing other apps that make
sound from working properly.

0:18:12.300,0:18:14.920
This caused me quite a few
headaches during user-testing,

0:18:14.920,0:18:18.680
...because the act of booting up Dorico
caused our video conference calls to crash.

0:18:18.900,0:18:21.660
"I don’t know if you can hear me or not
but I can no longer hear you."

0:18:21.940,0:18:23.080
Not cool, Dorico!

0:18:23.520,0:18:25.600
The setting to turn this off is in 'Preferences',

0:18:26.260,0:18:26.860
...'Play',

0:18:26.860,0:18:29.820
...then scroll down to turn off
this miserable little tickbox.

0:18:29.820,0:18:30.560
You’re welcome.

0:18:30.860,0:18:34.540
Secondly, if you try to open Dorico
before your sound library is installed,

0:18:34.540,0:18:37.200
...it will default to something called ‘Dorico Beep’,

0:18:37.200,0:18:41.440
...which is a basic sampler that is so distorted
and set to such an insanely loud volume

0:18:41.440,0:18:43.620
...that it might take your head off if you’re not careful.

0:18:43.620,0:18:47.840
Watch this poor unsuspecting soul pressing 'Play'
in Dorico for the first time with headphones on.

0:18:47.840,0:18:49.060
"Coldplay's 'Clocks'."

0:18:51.320,0:18:52.220
"Alright..."

0:18:52.220,0:18:53.680
"And I'm gonna press 'Play'."

0:18:55.240,0:18:56.120
"Oh, jes-"

0:19:00.420,0:19:02.140
"Holy [REDACTED]!"

0:19:21.080,0:19:22.120
So, next up,

0:19:22.120,0:19:24.240
...our testers needed to set up their score

0:19:24.240,0:19:26.780
...by choosing the instruments they wanted to write for.

0:19:26.780,0:19:31.480
Now, all the major players provide an 'Instruments'
pop-up which allows you to do this right away.

0:19:31.480,0:19:32.480
Makes sense.

0:19:32.480,0:19:35.280
But the Dorico team have altered this idea a little,

0:19:35.280,0:19:37.740
...by introducing the concept of ‘Players’,

0:19:37.740,0:19:41.060
...which are meant to represent the
actual people who’ll be playing the piece

0:19:41.060,0:19:44.260
...with each ‘Player’ needing to be
assigned their own instrument.

0:19:44.260,0:19:48.020
This is reminiscent of an old app
from the 90’s called 'Igor Engraver',

0:19:48.020,0:19:50.240
...which had a similar list called ‘Musicians’.

0:19:50.460,0:19:52.360
There are good reasons for doing this:

0:19:52.360,0:19:57.180
First, it provides a framework that allows you to assign
more than one instrument to an individual player.

0:19:57.180,0:20:01.560
For example, if you have a percussionist in charge
of multiple instruments, you can set that up here.

0:20:01.560,0:20:03.720
This is also a structurally useful tool.

0:20:03.720,0:20:06.620
By creating this identifiable list, which is a set,

0:20:06.620,0:20:10.060
...not of instruments but of the people
who are holding those instruments,

0:20:10.060,0:20:13.680
...they've unlocked some very powerful
score-creation and layout possibilities,

0:20:13.680,0:20:14.840
...which we’ll get to shortly.

0:20:15.120,0:20:18.140
But the drawback of this system
is that it creates a complication

0:20:18.140,0:20:20.380
...that makes the process of setting up a score

0:20:20.380,0:20:22.860
...more cumbersome and difficult to understand.

0:20:22.860,0:20:27.240
First, it forces new users to have to engage
with the awkward concept of having an

0:20:27.240,0:20:29.380
...‘Empty-handed Player’ in their project,

0:20:29.380,0:20:31.360
...which I watched stress a few people out.

0:20:31.360,0:20:32.940
"I didn’t understand it and it got in the way,"

0:20:32.940,0:20:36.500
"...and it’s only when I’m watching this video
back that I understand where I went wrong."

0:20:36.780,0:20:39.100
Another problem I saw was the following:

0:20:39.100,0:20:40.540
After you choose an instrument,

0:20:40.540,0:20:42.280
...this Instrument panel closes.

0:20:42.280,0:20:42.880
Oh.

0:20:42.880,0:20:43.940
What do you do now?

0:20:43.940,0:20:46.860
Well, a lot of people look at
these hieroglyphics down here:

0:20:46.860,0:20:47.700
'Person'

0:20:47.700,0:20:48.440
'People'

0:20:48.440,0:20:49.900
'Mecha-Rainbow'?

0:20:49.900,0:20:50.540
uh

0:20:50.540,0:20:51.960
'CD rack'?

0:20:51.960,0:20:54.200
...and understandably steer clear of them.

0:20:54.200,0:20:58.820
So instead, a lot of people clicked on
this pretty inviting '+' button here,

0:20:58.820,0:21:01.280
...since it’s the thing that best describes their intention:

0:21:01.280,0:21:02.780
‘I want to add something’.

0:21:02.780,0:21:04.340
The problem is, that by doing this,

0:21:04.340,0:21:07.380
...you’re actually assigning this
player another instrument,

0:21:07.380,0:21:10.460
..which is a concept first-time
users don’t yet understand.

0:21:10.620,0:21:13.160
"What happened to the... violin and piano?"

0:21:13.160,0:21:16.260
"Because it seems like I only have trumpet on my score."

0:21:16.260,0:21:17.460
"Yeah..."

0:21:18.080,0:21:20.040
"Currently I'm doing something wrong."

0:21:20.260,0:21:25.540
Another issue this creates is that it makes the process
of setting up a non-standard orchestral ensemble

0:21:25.540,0:21:27.640
...much slower than Finale or Sibelius.

0:21:27.880,0:21:30.600
With Finale for example, when
I want to start a new project,

0:21:30.600,0:21:33.320
...a dialog appears where I can
quickly choose all my instruments

0:21:33.320,0:21:34.800
...by pressing this 'Add >' button,

0:21:34.800,0:21:38.160
...which are automatically arranged
into a sensible default ordering:

0:21:38.160,0:21:40.960
Woodwinds at the top, strings at the bottom, et cetera.

0:21:41.160,0:21:45.340
With Dorico, the concept of needing to add a
player first before assigning them an instrument

0:21:45.340,0:21:46.600
...slows things down.

0:21:46.600,0:21:49.960
And since this dialog keeps
disappearing after you add players,

0:21:49.960,0:21:51.760
...you very quickly find yourself wondering,

0:21:51.760,0:21:55.320
'Is there a way I can add multiple players
and not have to do this one-by-one?’

0:21:55.580,0:21:57.260
And then you look down here and...

0:21:57.260,0:22:00.700
...you’d be forgiven for thinking that this
is the option that allows you to do that.

0:22:00.940,0:22:01.500
Nope.

0:22:01.500,0:22:03.440
This is something called a ‘Section Player’,

0:22:03.440,0:22:07.240
...which refers to a section of musicians
all reading from the same staff,

0:22:07.240,0:22:08.480
...like a string section.

0:22:08.660,0:22:10.600
So, this is a further complication.

0:22:10.600,0:22:12.880
We’re no longer just looking at a list of players.

0:22:12.880,0:22:16.480
It’s a list of players where one of them
is itself a group of more players.

0:22:16.820,0:22:20.380
So if you want to add multiple players
who all play different instruments,

0:22:20.380,0:22:22.120
...that’s what the Mecha-Rainbow is for.

0:22:22.120,0:22:25.200
The icon is meant to be an
ensemble seating chart, by the way.

0:22:25.200,0:22:27.120
Uh... Congrats if you figured that out.

0:22:27.120,0:22:28.740
But even this is inflexible,

0:22:28.740,0:22:31.680
...only allowing you to choose
from a few types of grouping.

0:22:31.680,0:22:33.760
"I'm gonna try and do a piano quintet."

0:22:35.520,0:22:38.580
"Okay, I guess it doesn't give quintets by default."

0:22:38.580,0:22:40.680
For the orchestral piece I wrote in Dorico,

0:22:40.680,0:22:43.120
...I wanted 2 alto sax and 1 tenor sax,

0:22:43.120,0:22:44.600
...which I could kind of get,

0:22:44.600,0:22:47.080
...along with a bunch of additional
instruments I didn’t want.

0:22:47.080,0:22:48.840
So, I added this list,

0:22:48.840,0:22:50.900
...then deleted all the unneeded instruments,

0:22:50.900,0:22:53.300
...then added the missing second alto sax player.

0:22:53.300,0:22:56.540
No big deal, but it does feel quite
slow compared to the competition.

0:22:57.060,0:22:58.440
And by the time I’d finished,

0:22:58.440,0:23:01.240
...the instruments were arranged
completely incorrectly too.

0:23:01.240,0:23:04.140
So I had to drag them around
into a sensible order manually.

0:23:04.420,0:23:07.060
Not to mention, after I’d finished adding instruments,

0:23:07.060,0:23:08.860
...look at the state of this score!

0:23:08.860,0:23:13.300
So, again, unlike Sibelius which automatically
tries to pick a sensible default layout,

0:23:13.300,0:23:17.540
...I have to now go on the hunt for the settings
which allow me to change the staff and paper size.

0:23:17.900,0:23:19.380
Here’s another minor annoyance

0:23:19.380,0:23:23.440
...that can be illustrated by watching this user
coming to grips with instrument setup.

0:23:23.640,0:23:25.740
He’s now trying to delete some unwanted players,

0:23:25.740,0:23:28.900
...and this annoying dialog keeps
popping up each time to ask

0:23:28.900,0:23:30.640
...whether he wants to delete the player

0:23:30.640,0:23:32.700
...or the player and the part layouts.

0:23:32.700,0:23:33.640
But the thing is:

0:23:33.640,0:23:36.060
...he’s only trying to delete an 'Empty-handed Player',

0:23:36.060,0:23:38.740
...so any parts assigned to them are going to be empty.

0:23:38.740,0:23:43.780
It feels like a fairly unnecessary and semi-abstract
question to be presenting him with at this moment.

0:23:44.040,0:23:46.780
Here’s another user engaging with
this dialog for the first time,

0:23:46.780,0:23:49.260
...who opted to only delete the player, because

0:23:49.260,0:23:51.400
...the options being put in front of him aren’t clear.

0:23:51.400,0:23:53.300
"Yeah, there’s no music written yet, so that's fine."

0:23:53.300,0:23:54.640
"I can delete that one."

0:23:54.640,0:23:55.520
As a consequence,

0:23:55.520,0:23:59.320
...he now has an orphaned part over here that’s
going to cause some confusion down the road.

0:23:59.540,0:24:02.000
Oh man, I haven’t even got to this panel yet.

0:24:02.000,0:24:04.000
Right, let’s mosey on over here.

0:24:04.000,0:24:07.440
So this list, on first glance, looks like the same thing.

0:24:07.440,0:24:08.380
But no,

0:24:08.380,0:24:10.280
...let me quickly explain what it is.

0:24:10.280,0:24:11.620
This is the Layouts panel,

0:24:11.620,0:24:15.080
...which is a list of the scores and part scores
that have been auto-generated

0:24:15.080,0:24:17.220
...as you were adding players over here.

0:24:17.220,0:24:19.600
This is also a concept from Igor Engraver,

0:24:19.600,0:24:21.420
...which has been reimagined in Dorico.

0:24:21.420,0:24:22.680
And let me be clear here:

0:24:22.680,0:24:24.020
This idea is great.

0:24:24.020,0:24:26.700
The Dorico team were right to take inspiration from Igor,

0:24:26.700,0:24:29.940
...but their version does involve
some very unusual behaviour.

0:24:29.940,0:24:32.580
For example, if I click on the 'Flute' player over here,

0:24:32.580,0:24:35.440
...we can see tickboxes in the Layouts panel on the right,

0:24:35.440,0:24:38.200
...which are showing the scores
where the flute is being applied,

0:24:38.200,0:24:41.100
...and in this case, the ‘Full score’
and the individual flute part.

0:24:41.100,0:24:44.260
And if I want the flute to be added
to anything else, I can just tick it.

0:24:44.260,0:24:47.520
For example, I’ve now added the
flute player to this oboe part.

0:24:47.520,0:24:48.540
Okay so far.

0:24:48.540,0:24:50.780
But now if I click on a score in this list,

0:24:50.780,0:24:52.140
...the arrangement reverses.

0:24:52.140,0:24:56.000
Now the score is selected and these
instruments become tickboxes,

0:24:56.000,0:24:59.600
...which basically means that there are
two reversed ways of doing the same thing.

0:24:59.600,0:25:00.940
It’s really strange,

0:25:00.940,0:25:03.580
...especially because the panels
are on either side of the screen

0:25:03.580,0:25:06.080
...so it’s not visually obvious
they’re connected in any way,

0:25:06.080,0:25:09.520
...and you have to keep ping-ponging back and forth
to understand the relationship between them.

0:25:09.520,0:25:12.280
And this setup has some other
weird knock-on effects too,

0:25:12.280,0:25:15.560
...like if you arrange the instruments
into a sensible order on one side,

0:25:15.560,0:25:17.220
...the other side doesn’t follow suit,

0:25:17.220,0:25:19.320
...so the connections are all over the place.

0:25:19.320,0:25:19.900
Look!

0:25:20.660,0:25:21.500
...over here!

0:25:22.560,0:25:23.300
...over here!

0:25:24.100,0:25:25.820
Uh... All the way down here.

0:25:25.820,0:25:29.080
The shame about this is the options
being provided are really powerful

0:25:29.080,0:25:32.240
...because you can create as many
variations of parts as you want.

0:25:32.240,0:25:34.200
Like, if you’re writing for piano trio,

0:25:34.200,0:25:37.460
...and the cellist tells you they want
to see the piano in their part score,

0:25:37.460,0:25:40.760
...you can just click on the piano and
add it to the cello score right away,

0:25:40.760,0:25:43.220
...or click on the cello score and add the piano.

0:25:43.220,0:25:43.920
Whatever.

0:25:43.920,0:25:45.000
But as I said earlier,

0:25:45.000,0:25:46.940
...when you arrive at the app for the first time,

0:25:46.940,0:25:47.820
...all of these,

0:25:47.820,0:25:50.240
...all these bizarre icons and interrelationships

0:25:50.240,0:25:51.920
...smack you in the face at once.

0:25:51.920,0:25:53.020
It's baffling.

0:25:53.020,0:25:55.460
And don’t even get me started about this down here:

0:25:55.460,0:25:56.300
Flows,

0:25:56.300,0:25:59.680
...a way of creating sections,
or movements, or variations.

0:25:59.680,0:26:01.620
I don’t want to get into it too much right now.

0:26:01.620,0:26:04.500
It’s another nice idea which, when clicked on, reveals:

0:26:04.500,0:26:06.420
Oh no! A three-way relationship!

0:26:06.420,0:26:07.600
AAAAAAHHH!

0:26:07.600,0:26:11.120
And what I found particularly strange
about this whole Setup page is that,

0:26:11.120,0:26:14.360
...despite having an entire section
devoted to setting up your score,

0:26:14.360,0:26:16.680
...it’s missing some really essential stuff like

0:26:16.680,0:26:18.140
...staff and paper size,

0:26:18.140,0:26:19.800
...which you remember from a moment ago,

0:26:19.800,0:26:23.240
...you’re definitely going to have to edit
if you are creating an orchestral score.

0:26:23.620,0:26:25.500
Oddly, if I expand one of these,

0:26:25.500,0:26:28.580
...you can see the page size referenced
but you can’t actually edit it.

0:26:28.980,0:26:29.780
Why?

0:26:29.780,0:26:31.920
You can look but you can’t touch.

0:26:31.920,0:26:33.800
So if you want to change these settings,

0:26:33.800,0:26:36.640
...you have to right-click here
and choose ‘Layout Options...’

0:26:36.640,0:26:38.460
...to open this dialog box.

0:26:38.460,0:26:40.000
If you change the layout size,

0:26:40.000,0:26:42.960
...you have to then close the dialog
and navigate to the score itself

0:26:42.960,0:26:45.020
...to see the effect of the changes you’ve made.

0:26:45.020,0:26:46.420
This is particularly jarring

0:26:46.420,0:26:48.260
...because Sibelius does this much better.

0:26:48.260,0:26:50.100
Look, I can change the staff size here

0:26:50.100,0:26:51.840
...and the score updates accordingly.

0:26:51.840,0:26:55.640
Overall, the interconnectedness of
this system is not obvious at all,

0:26:55.640,0:26:58.780
...and the only way to learn it is
to watch a lot of tutorial videos.

0:26:58.780,0:26:59.680
And just so you know,

0:26:59.680,0:27:02.140
...as a designer, you generally want to avoid that,

0:27:02.140,0:27:04.000
...especially for core functionality.

0:27:04.000,0:27:07.240
For this kind of stuff, every time the
user needs to consult the manual,

0:27:07.240,0:27:09.260
...it is kind of a failure of design.

0:27:09.260,0:27:10.520
This system is very clever,

0:27:10.520,0:27:13.000
...but also inelegant and quite cumbersome.

0:27:13.000,0:27:16.300
And as a result, Dorico is not
an app that suddenly 'clicks',

0:27:16.300,0:27:19.140
...it’s an app that slowly dawns on you over time.

0:27:21.500,0:27:23.500
So, regarding score setup,

0:27:23.500,0:27:25.200
...are these pain points unavoidable?

0:27:25.200,0:27:30.380
Does the inclusion of all these clever ideas mean
that the app has to be naturally harder to learn?

0:27:30.380,0:27:34.040
Well, I'm sure it won’t surprise you to
find out that I think the answer is 'No'.

0:27:34.040,0:27:38.820
I think some of this information could be sequenced
so that the user isn’t hit with all of it at once.

0:27:38.820,0:27:41.000
We have a structural problem to solve first.

0:27:41.000,0:27:45.720
This interconnected ping-pong layout is hampering
the ability to provide other useful settings,

0:27:45.720,0:27:48.720
...and is also causing the Players
panel to be over-complicated,

0:27:48.720,0:27:51.440
...especially the way you have to
keep re-opening the same dialog.

0:27:51.440,0:27:54.160
When you have to keep doing that,
it may as well be a dialog.

0:27:54.160,0:27:56.000
So, let’s remove players from here,

0:27:56.000,0:27:58.320
...and instead, when a user starts a new project,

0:27:58.320,0:28:02.140
...you show a dialog that places the Instruments
on the left and the Players on the right.

0:28:02.560,0:28:04.780
Now anyone coming from one of the competitor apps,

0:28:04.780,0:28:07.420
...which is the audience Dorico is targeting by the way,

0:28:07.420,0:28:09.080
...will know exactly what the deal is.

0:28:09.080,0:28:11.540
You can select instruments and add them quickly.

0:28:11.540,0:28:15.000
And each time you do this, a new
player is automatically created,

0:28:15.000,0:28:18.820
...allowing us to discard the confusing
concept of an ‘Empty-handed Player'.

0:28:18.820,0:28:23.100
And if you want to add more instruments to the same
player, or change the instrument they are holding,

0:28:23.100,0:28:25.120
...you can drag them into these slots.

0:28:25.120,0:28:27.580
This would allow you to change instruments later too.

0:28:27.580,0:28:28.920
And regarding the ordering,

0:28:28.920,0:28:31.940
...you’ll notice that the instruments have
been organised sensibly by default,

0:28:31.940,0:28:34.380
...and you can still drag to rearrange them if you want.

0:28:34.780,0:28:36.940
And once you’ve finished, you can close this dialog,

0:28:36.940,0:28:40.540
...and then you’re left with just
one list, which is the list of parts.

0:28:40.540,0:28:41.580
Why would I do this?

0:28:41.580,0:28:43.120
Well, let me demonstrate.

0:28:43.120,0:28:44.700
First, if you click on a part,

0:28:44.700,0:28:46.920
...now the appropriate score appears in front of you.

0:28:46.920,0:28:49.160
And if you want to edit the
number of players in that score,

0:28:49.160,0:28:52.020
...they can be immediately accessed
from this subordinate list,

0:28:52.020,0:28:55.080
...where the relationship between
players and parts is much clearer.

0:28:55.080,0:28:56.940
Moreover, now that you have this pattern,

0:28:56.940,0:28:59.840
...you can use tabs to expose useful common settings,

0:28:59.840,0:29:01.640
...like staff and page sizes.

0:29:01.640,0:29:02.420
The difference is,

0:29:02.420,0:29:05.960
...unlike the existing dialog box,
where you change these values,

0:29:05.960,0:29:08.120
...the score updates to reflect them immediately.

0:29:08.120,0:29:10.260
All in all, a much friendlier system.

0:29:10.260,0:29:12.180
The information is sequenced sensibly,

0:29:12.180,0:29:13.780
...options are exposed when you need them,

0:29:13.780,0:29:17.460
...and crucially, you can see the effect of
the changes you make to the settings.

0:29:17.460,0:29:19.840
Not to mention, because we’ve decluttered the page,

0:29:19.840,0:29:23.200
...it’s less likely to make your head spin
and you can see more of the score.

0:29:23.200,0:29:25.140
There are a few more bits of hooking-up to do,

0:29:25.140,0:29:29.480
...like making the players dialog easy to
find, and connecting it to flows, et cetera.

0:29:29.480,0:29:32.420
Those are fairly straight-forward
to solve using similar solutions.

0:29:32.420,0:29:34.800
I think you get the idea, so let’s move on.

0:29:38.900,0:29:43.020
Now, finally, we'll get to the part where our
testers were ready to write some music.

0:29:43.020,0:29:46.440
Everything we’ve been looking at so far
was contained in the ‘Setup’ tab.

0:29:46.440,0:29:49.760
But in order to write music, you now
need to move to the ‘Write’ tab.

0:29:49.760,0:29:53.160
And when you do this, the app
changes significantly for the better.

0:29:53.160,0:29:55.520
Gone are the esoteric, interconnected lists,

0:29:55.520,0:29:59.620
...and instead appears what looks like
a pretty sensible and intuitive layout.

0:29:59.620,0:30:01.920
This was my impression when I first used Dorico,

0:30:01.920,0:30:03.860
...and the people I tested largely agreed.

0:30:03.860,0:30:07.120
Here’s one person describing the layout
after seeing it for the first time:

0:30:07.560,0:30:08.280
"Okay, this looks-"

0:30:08.280,0:30:09.440
"This looks nice and simple."

0:30:09.440,0:30:10.780
"First impression is pretty good."

0:30:10.780,0:30:13.200
"Uh... I got my note input on the left-hand side,"

0:30:13.840,0:30:16.440
"...other stuff on the right-hand side."

0:30:16.440,0:30:18.280
"They seem nice and clean. I like that."

0:30:18.620,0:30:21.240
If you’re a designer, it’s exactly what you want to hear.

0:30:21.240,0:30:24.200
He doesn’t exactly know precisely what
he’ll find on either side of the page,

0:30:24.200,0:30:26.920
...but he has a pretty good idea
of the general organisation

0:30:26.920,0:30:29.180
...without having to think too deeply about it.

0:30:29.180,0:30:31.200
This side is concerned with writing music,

0:30:31.200,0:30:34.780
...this side contains markings and techniques
that you can apply to that music.

0:30:34.780,0:30:36.480
And when you select stuff on the score,

0:30:36.480,0:30:39.100
...you can choose from a few
contextual options down here.

0:30:39.100,0:30:43.660
This time around, there doesn’t appear to be any
interconnected functionality on either side of the score.

0:30:43.660,0:30:45.840
Any linked controls, like these two parts,

0:30:45.840,0:30:48.020
...are situated beside each other, which helps,

0:30:48.020,0:30:50.320
...and the connection was obvious to everyone I tested.

0:30:50.320,0:30:53.920
And there’s some lovely visual and
organisational subtlety here too.

0:30:53.920,0:30:54.900
In this panel,

0:30:54.900,0:30:58.580
...they’ve laid out the most common note
durations, accidentals and articulations,

0:30:58.580,0:31:01.380
...with clear separator lines
that makes it very easy to read.

0:31:01.380,0:31:03.780
I also really like this panel on the right.

0:31:03.780,0:31:06.740
Each collection of elements
is represented by a clear icon,

0:31:06.740,0:31:10.700
...and the contents of each section is organised
in a way that makes it really intuitive.

0:31:10.700,0:31:12.840
And it works in lots of different ways too.

0:31:12.840,0:31:16.660
For example, if you’re the kind of person who
likes to click on something first, and then apply it,

0:31:16.660,0:31:17.520
...you can.

0:31:17.520,0:31:21.300
Or, if you prefer to select the destination
first and make your selection afterwards,

0:31:21.300,0:31:22.340
...you can do that too.

0:31:22.740,0:31:26.520
And the impact this design finesse
had on first-time usage was evident.

0:31:26.520,0:31:29.440
No one failed to figure out how
to apply things to the score.

0:31:29.440,0:31:33.320
And with a few exceptions, people generally
didn’t get lost once they got to this page.

0:31:33.600,0:31:38.000
I also really like how many extended techniques
and modern notation concepts you find here.

0:31:38.000,0:31:41.880
Not only is it convenient, but also
educational for new composers,

0:31:41.880,0:31:45.780
...and I wouldn’t be surprised if many people
ended up discovering and using these techniques

0:31:45.780,0:31:48.060
...simply by virtue of exploring this app.

0:31:48.720,0:31:51.840
There is one quite painful issue
I’d love to see addressed,

0:31:51.840,0:31:55.160
...which is how hard they make it
to add bars when you get started.

0:31:55.160,0:31:56.840
You see, when you start a new project,

0:31:56.840,0:31:58.680
...you get what looks like one bar.

0:31:58.680,0:32:02.060
What you don’t realise is that this isn’t really a bar at all.

0:32:02.060,0:32:03.020
It’s infinite,

0:32:03.020,0:32:06.320
...and no matter how many notes you
add, you can never get to a new bar.

0:32:06.320,0:32:10.780
Moreover, you can’t create a new bar despite
there being a very clear option for it.

0:32:10.780,0:32:13.920
So, the trick here is to add a time signature first.

0:32:13.920,0:32:16.240
Unless you figure that out, you’re going nowhere.

0:32:16.980,0:32:20.160
Why they don’t disable this button when
it doesn’t do anything is beyond me.

0:32:20.160,0:32:23.900
Better yet, why not just ask them to
specify a time signature at that point.

0:32:23.900,0:32:26.500
Half of the people I tested had this specific issue,

0:32:26.500,0:32:28.840
...and I can’t understand why they don’t smooth it out.

0:32:28.840,0:32:31.700
Now, this complaint might make
experienced users groan,

0:32:31.700,0:32:33.720
...but it’s a first-time user trap.

0:32:33.720,0:32:34.600
It is logical,

0:32:34.600,0:32:37.980
...but you only see that logic when
you're on the other side of the problem.

0:32:37.980,0:32:41.900
And another consequence of this is that
when users first try to enter some notes,

0:32:41.900,0:32:44.300
...the fact that this really is an infinite bar

0:32:44.300,0:32:47.320
...causes the subdivision marking
to function quite poorly,

0:32:47.320,0:32:50.500
...and results in the user accidentally
entering the wrong note values.

0:32:50.500,0:32:55.040
It’s an awful first experience if you don’t think
to enter a time signature at the outset.

0:32:55.620,0:32:57.620


0:33:03.820,0:33:05.160
Now, in saying all of this,

0:33:05.160,0:33:08.740
...I shouldn’t gloss over the fact that
this initial state you find yourself in

0:33:08.740,0:33:13.280
...is actually a very permissive system if you
want to write music that’s free of any meter,

0:33:13.280,0:33:18.660
...which, for many composers interested in modern
techniques from the 20th or 21st century, is a big deal.

0:33:18.660,0:33:20.880
And what’s more, it’s been built to work this way,

0:33:20.880,0:33:25.080
...unlike Sibelius, where any free-metered
solution always feels like a hack.

0:33:25.080,0:33:28.740
However, I think the option to write
free-metered music should be opt-in,

0:33:28.740,0:33:30.300
...and certainly not the default.

0:33:30.300,0:33:34.080
But definitely kudos to the Dorico team
for building a system that facilitates it.

0:33:34.080,0:33:36.020
If you're interested in learning more about this,

0:33:36.020,0:33:39.080
...I’ve put a link to a relevant
tutorial in the description below.

0:33:39.080,0:33:43.200
Okay, I should probably address this
faint grey rectangle you see everywhere.

0:33:43.200,0:33:45.340
Oh, you know what? Let’s not right now.

0:33:45.340,0:33:47.900
Uh... Let's just pop it down here and we’ll get to it later.

0:33:48.660,0:33:52.000
So with all that said, what’s it
like writing music on the score?

0:33:52.000,0:33:53.700
Well, regarding basic note input,

0:33:53.700,0:33:55.620
...it works in a pretty standard way:

0:33:55.620,0:33:58.300
You click on a note value and enter it on the score,

0:33:58.300,0:34:01.940
...or you can enter notes using a
computer keyboard or MIDI keyboard.

0:34:01.940,0:34:06.180
In addition, they provide a marking above the stave
that describes how the beat is subdivided.

0:34:06.180,0:34:07.460
So far, so good.

0:34:07.460,0:34:09.280
But once you look a little closer,

0:34:09.280,0:34:12.000
...Dorico’s system does some very strange things,

0:34:12.000,0:34:16.060
...and it can’t simply be explained by listing
out each feature in isolation because

0:34:16.060,0:34:19.040
...here, again, they’ve linked
together certain functionalities

0:34:19.040,0:34:22.040
...for reasons that are initially tricky to understand.

0:34:22.660,0:34:28.680
It all seems to hang one or two hard rules which
seem like lines in the sand that they refuse to cross,

0:34:28.680,0:34:30.280
...with the rest of the interaction model being

0:34:30.280,0:34:34.480
...a collection of workarounds that solve the
awkward consequences of those rules.

0:34:34.480,0:34:35.660
Let me show you what I mean.

0:34:35.940,0:34:37.280
So, the most obvious rule

0:34:37.280,0:34:41.040
...is that notation should always
appear ‘correctly’ on the score.

0:34:41.040,0:34:43.960
Now, right away, we can see
why this rule is so compelling.

0:34:43.960,0:34:46.000
Who’s going to advocate for incorrectness?

0:34:46.000,0:34:48.680
And to give an example of how this rule is realised,

0:34:48.680,0:34:52.260
...let’s select a quarter note and
place it here before the strong beat,

0:34:52.260,0:34:56.080
...and you can see that now Dorico
is creating two tied 8th notes,

0:34:56.080,0:34:57.700
...which is... correct.

0:34:57.700,0:35:01.280
Now, the second rule is more a
consequence of the way Dorico is built,

0:35:01.280,0:35:04.180
...and I’ll need to do some explaining
before it will make sense.

0:35:04.180,0:35:08.320
You see, Dorico has a particular way of
storing notes that differs from Sibelius.

0:35:08.320,0:35:11.400
With Sibelius, there’s a strict
structural hierarchy going on,

0:35:11.400,0:35:13.040
...with notes belonging to bars,

0:35:13.040,0:35:14.300
...bars belonging to staffs,

0:35:14.300,0:35:16.420
...staffs belonging to instruments, et cetera.

0:35:16.420,0:35:18.120
Dorico isn’t structured this way.

0:35:18.120,0:35:20.560
Their note durations are stored independent of bars,

0:35:20.560,0:35:24.500
...which is why they can achieve things
like allowing tuplets to cross barlines.

0:35:24.500,0:35:27.220
...something Sibelius frustratingly does not support.

0:35:27.220,0:35:30.000
To illustrate this, here’s a few bars in 6/8.

0:35:30.000,0:35:32.100
If we place a dotted quarter note here,

0:35:32.100,0:35:35.980
...watch what happens when I use a shortcut
to move it to the right by one subdivision?

0:35:36.480,0:35:39.100
Now, we can see that Dorico has applied the first rule:

0:35:39.100,0:35:42.220
...altering it so the notation
conforms to standard convention.

0:35:42.220,0:35:44.080
And what we’re looking at now appears to be:

0:35:44.080,0:35:46.720
A quarter note, a tie, and then an eighth note.

0:35:46.720,0:35:48.620
But if we click on one of these elements,

0:35:48.620,0:35:51.280
...we can see that they’re actually all linked together

0:35:51.280,0:35:53.500
...and that Dorico isn’t classifying them that way.

0:35:53.500,0:35:56.620
It’s still representing them as
one dotted quarter note in the UI,

0:35:56.620,0:36:00.640
...which means that it considers this
highlighted group to be a single duration.

0:36:00.640,0:36:02.100
And now that I’ve explained this,

0:36:02.100,0:36:04.360
...I can articulate their second interaction rule,

0:36:04.360,0:36:06.700
...which I’m going to call ‘duration is king’.

0:36:06.700,0:36:09.040
These aren’t individual durations tied together,

0:36:09.040,0:36:10.380
...they are one duration.

0:36:10.380,0:36:14.760
And if I click on any of them, only that
overall duration will be reflected in the UI.

0:36:14.760,0:36:17.260
And I suppose, again, this seems very logical.

0:36:17.260,0:36:19.000
But when it comes to writing quickly,

0:36:19.000,0:36:21.900
...these two rules have some
really annoying consequences,

0:36:21.900,0:36:24.580
...where Dorico’s corrections
actually become obstructions.

0:36:24.580,0:36:27.660
And remember that question I asked
at the beginning of this video?

0:36:27.660,0:36:29.420
'How much suffering is involved?'

0:36:29.420,0:36:31.440
Well, that’s what I’m about to show you now,

0:36:31.440,0:36:34.660
...a bunch of seemingly insignificant
issues that really add up

0:36:34.660,0:36:38.540
...as you encounter them hundreds, if not
thousands of times in a single score.

0:36:38.540,0:36:41.120
Okay, so here I’m copying this little flourish,

0:36:41.120,0:36:44.060
...and I want it to be placed on
the last eight note of this bar.

0:36:44.060,0:36:45.020
In Sibelius,

0:36:45.020,0:36:48.760
...I can do this by clicking on that rest
and changing it to a smaller subdivision

0:36:48.760,0:36:52.860
...so I can quickly select this last
rest 8th note and paste it here.

0:36:52.860,0:36:55.640
Then I just need to clean up those first two rests again,

0:36:55.640,0:36:56.840
...and then I’m done.

0:36:56.840,0:36:59.140
With Dorico, I can’t do this because

0:36:59.140,0:37:00.080
...you guessed it,

0:37:00.080,0:37:04.680
...it’s really sloppy to allow multiple 8th-note
rests like this in finished music, so

0:37:04.680,0:37:06.080
...they disallow it completely.

0:37:06.380,0:37:08.580
Instead, we need to choose a workaround.

0:37:08.580,0:37:10.720
One way is to add a dud note first,

0:37:10.720,0:37:12.320
...and then select the final rest,

0:37:12.320,0:37:13.460
...paste in your music,

0:37:13.460,0:37:15.160
...then go back and delete the dud note.

0:37:15.820,0:37:19.200
But the solution Dorico recommends
is to simply paste the flourish here,

0:37:19.200,0:37:20.660
...and then use the shortcut:

0:37:20.660,0:37:24.000
'alt + cmd/command + right'
on Mac to shift it over two spaces.

0:37:24.000,0:37:25.480
But again, this is slower,

0:37:25.480,0:37:26.840
...and depending on the particulars,

0:37:26.840,0:37:30.100
...usually requires a little bit of thinking
and additional problem solving.

0:37:30.100,0:37:32.780
Another major pain is how ties are handled.

0:37:32.780,0:37:37.920
So, because the Dorico team wants us to understand
how the app internally handles note durations,

0:37:37.920,0:37:41.400
...if you select a tie, you automatically
select the notes it’s connected to,

0:37:41.400,0:37:42.880
...which is... okay.

0:37:42.880,0:37:45.420
But, they’ve decided to go all in with this idea

0:37:45.420,0:37:49.180
...by completely preventing you from selecting
any of the notes or ties individually.

0:37:49.180,0:37:52.580
And because of this, you keep coming
across these little mini puzzles.

0:37:52.580,0:37:55.060
Like, I want this note to cover these two rests,

0:37:55.060,0:37:56.240
...so... right,

0:37:56.240,0:37:58.200
...these add up to a half note, so...

0:37:58.200,0:38:00.220
Okay, a dotted half note will do it.

0:38:00.220,0:38:02.140
Like a Grade 3 refresher test.

0:38:02.460,0:38:05.640
In Sibelius, I can just select the last note and extend it.

0:38:05.640,0:38:08.860
This is particularly useful when
you end up in a situation like this.

0:38:08.860,0:38:12.700
In this case, I want to extend
the duration to fill that last rest.

0:38:13.060,0:38:16.100
Yeah, a dotted half-note isn’t going
to get you out of this one, is it?

0:38:16.100,0:38:20.920
At this point, the only thing you can do in Dorico
is to fiddle with this duration toggle down here,

0:38:20.920,0:38:24.680
...and use a shortcut to extend the
length of this duration by that amount.

0:38:24.680,0:38:26.060
Yes, they have the answer,

0:38:26.060,0:38:27.700
...but it’s a slow answer.

0:38:28.100,0:38:32.080
As for ties, you can’t delete them
without deleting all the other notes too.

0:38:32.080,0:38:34.820
Why do I care so much about being able to delete ties?

0:38:34.820,0:38:37.340
Well, because being a composer and not an engraver,

0:38:37.340,0:38:40.920
...my score is an evolving document
and I change my mind a lot.

0:38:40.920,0:38:43.840
Here in Sibelius, if I want to have this as a separate note,

0:38:43.840,0:38:45.860
...I just select the tie and delete it,

0:38:45.860,0:38:47.260
...then change the note.

0:38:47.260,0:38:49.040
In Dorico, no such luck.

0:38:49.040,0:38:50.540
You could learn another shortcut:

0:38:50.540,0:38:53.260
Holding 'alt' and 'shift' and pressing the left arrow key

0:38:53.260,0:38:54.720
...to reduce the duration,

0:38:54.720,0:38:56.520
...and then you have to just rewrite the note.

0:38:56.520,0:39:01.040
But, this isn’t good enough because it compounds the
work you have to do if there are multiple tied notes.

0:39:01.040,0:39:02.560
So, recognising this,

0:39:02.560,0:39:05.380
...Dorico created another button called the 'Scissors',

0:39:05.380,0:39:08.180
...which, when you press it, deletes all the selected ties,

0:39:08.180,0:39:10.380
...which feels a bit like a nuclear option.

0:39:10.820,0:39:12.720
Look, if I want to split this group of...

0:39:12.720,0:39:15.540
...urgh, I mean... this single duration in the middle,

0:39:15.540,0:39:17.760
I need to Scissors all the ties away,

0:39:18.360,0:39:19.740
...then re-add them here.

0:39:20.300,0:39:21.680
Then re-add them here.

0:39:22.000,0:39:23.740
In Sibelius, I delete that.

0:39:23.740,0:39:24.300
Done.

0:39:24.680,0:39:26.360
Now, I’m all for consistency,

0:39:26.360,0:39:30.260
...but this particular refusal to allow
users to select ties and delete them,

0:39:30.260,0:39:31.880
...comes across as obstinacy,

0:39:31.880,0:39:36.260
...and I sometimes wonder if the Dorico team weren’t
suffering a little from ‘Let’s Be Different’ syndrome

0:39:36.260,0:39:38.480
...to distinguish them from Sibelius and Finale.

0:39:38.480,0:39:39.160
I don’t know.

0:39:39.160,0:39:40.860
It just doesn’t feel like a feature.

0:39:40.860,0:39:42.320
It feels like a pain.

0:39:42.320,0:39:43.920
A scissory pain.

0:39:45.540,0:39:48.700
Here’s another consequence of
Dorico correctifying your score.

0:39:48.700,0:39:51.780
Say you’re writing a piece with very
specific dynamic instructions.

0:39:51.780,0:39:56.700
For example, offsetting dynamics played over
long durations on multiple instruments like this,

0:39:56.700,0:39:58.760
...which is common in spectral music.

0:39:58.760,0:40:03.180
Well, best practice is to split the tied notes
into unconventional groupings when needed

0:40:03.180,0:40:06.680
...in order to specify exactly where
the dynamics begin and end.

0:40:06.680,0:40:11.020
Left by itself, the system I’ve described so far
would make this impossible to achieve.

0:40:11.020,0:40:12.640
So, recognising this,

0:40:12.640,0:40:15.780
...Dorico created a new button called 'Force Duration',

0:40:15.780,0:40:19.320
...which allows me to lock the duration
so it won’t be automatically corrected.

0:40:19.320,0:40:22.280
Here, I’ve copied and pasted
the dynamic timings that I want,

0:40:22.280,0:40:25.180
...and now I need to set the
durations to match those timings.

0:40:25.180,0:40:28.120
And wait until you see how much faff is involved in this.

0:40:28.120,0:40:31.280
First, I have to use the scissors,
which removes all the ties.

0:40:31.280,0:40:34.260
Then I split this so I have a quarter note on the 4th beat,

0:40:34.260,0:40:36.460
...where the fortissimo dynamic is positioned.

0:40:36.460,0:40:37.940
So, I click on the first note

0:40:37.940,0:40:40.120
...and press the 'Tie' button twice to extend it.

0:40:40.660,0:40:42.760
Bear in mind that if I press it again at this point,

0:40:42.760,0:40:45.340
...it would recombine everything
in this bar all over again.

0:40:45.340,0:40:48.160
So I now need to make this quarter
note stay here and not go away,

0:40:48.160,0:40:49.040
...so I select it

0:40:49.040,0:40:51.660
...and then apply the ‘Force duration' button here.

0:40:51.660,0:40:55.540
Finally, I press the tie button a few more
times to link it all back together again.

0:40:55.540,0:40:57.360
When you are familiar with the Sibelius workflow,

0:40:57.360,0:40:59.280
...this is difficult to be satisfied with.

0:40:59.280,0:41:02.800
With Sibelius, I just change the durations
to be the way I want them to be

0:41:02.800,0:41:05.360
...and reapply any ties I lose along the way,

0:41:05.360,0:41:07.680
...and I just tidy up any loose ends afterwards.

0:41:07.680,0:41:09.340
No special modes needed.

0:41:09.340,0:41:14.800
The tidying up doesn’t bother me because it’s faster
and I don’t need to formulate a game plan in advance.

0:41:17.360,0:41:20.360
And this brings me to one visual
criticism I have of Dorico:

0:41:20.360,0:41:21.240
This panel,

0:41:21.240,0:41:23.980
...with its collection of buttons that are styled identically

0:41:23.980,0:41:25.900
...but which work in very different ways.

0:41:26.280,0:41:29.580
Generally speaking, it’s a good idea
to differentiate things visually

0:41:29.580,0:41:31.300
...to indicate differences in function.

0:41:31.740,0:41:32.920
To give a blunt example:

0:41:32.920,0:41:34.660
Switches turn things on and off,

0:41:34.660,0:41:36.040
...checkboxes are conditions,

0:41:36.040,0:41:38.420
...and buttons are usually reserved for actions.

0:41:38.420,0:41:40.140
You can be more subtle than this

0:41:40.140,0:41:42.200
...by having different sizes or arrangements,

0:41:42.200,0:41:43.700
...but here, well...

0:41:43.700,0:41:48.380
This first button is a condition that alters notes
before or after you place them on the score.

0:41:48.380,0:41:51.700
This 'Rest' button is a condition that
can only be applied to the score,

0:41:51.700,0:41:54.200
...but you can’t convert a note to a rest afterwards,

0:41:54.200,0:41:55.300
...which is weird.

0:41:55.300,0:41:57.420
This 'Chord' button is an on/off setting.

0:41:57.420,0:42:01.580
This 'Tuplet' button is an action that can only
be applied to something already on the score.

0:42:01.580,0:42:05.300
This 'Grace Note' button is a condition
that applies to the selected duration,

0:42:05.300,0:42:06.700
...but often doesn’t do anything,

0:42:06.700,0:42:08.980
...and then turns off for reasons I can’t figure out.

0:42:08.980,0:42:12.660
The ‘Input Mode’ and ‘Lock to Duration’
buttons are on/off settings.

0:42:12.660,0:42:16.240
Input mode deactivates Chord mode,
by the way, so watch out for that.

0:42:16.240,0:42:19.280
Then there are our old friends ‘Force Duration’ and ‘Cut',

0:42:19.280,0:42:22.780
...which are actions that can only be applied
to notes that are already on the score,

0:42:22.780,0:42:25.000
...although ‘Force Duration’ can be unapplied,

0:42:25.000,0:42:26.980
...whereas 'Cut' is one and done.

0:42:26.980,0:42:30.020
The 'Tie' button is an action that
only applies to notes on the score.

0:42:30.020,0:42:31.340
And saving the best for last,

0:42:31.340,0:42:34.860
...there’s ‘Select’, the on/off setting
that makes these buttons not work.

0:42:34.860,0:42:39.600
In testing, I watched people flounder around
with this panel over and over again.

0:42:39.600,0:42:40.300
Why?

0:42:40.300,0:42:44.240
Because it’s a disparate collection of
on/off toggles, conditions, and actions,

0:42:44.240,0:42:45.640
...which are all identical-looking

0:42:45.640,0:42:48.020
...yet which work in completely different ways.

0:42:48.020,0:42:52.040
The communication sets up expectations
that contradicts the actual logic.

0:42:52.040,0:42:53.320
And speaking for myself,

0:42:53.320,0:42:56.440
...even though I’ve been using
Dorico every day for over 8 months

0:42:56.440,0:42:58.560
...and have written a full orchestral piece in it,

0:42:58.560,0:43:01.560
...not to mention the fact that I’ve
watched a gazillion tutorials about it,

0:43:01.560,0:43:04.920
...and read god knows how many
forum posts and articles about it,

0:43:04.920,0:43:08.860
...this panel still manages to wrong-foot
me nearly every time I use it.

0:43:09.480,0:43:11.140
Here, I’m selecting a dotted rest,

0:43:11.140,0:43:14.020
...which causes the ‘Rest’ and ‘Dot’
buttons to be highlighted,

0:43:14.020,0:43:15.040
...which makes sense,

0:43:15.040,0:43:17.380
...but trying to alter the duration doesn’t do anything.

0:43:17.380,0:43:21.140
As a result, you end up with two different
durations selected at the same time.

0:43:21.140,0:43:23.740
Worse, I can turn off the 'Dotted Duration' button,

0:43:23.740,0:43:25.520
...which doesn't make any sense because, again,

0:43:25.520,0:43:27.720
...Dorico prevents it from having any effect.

0:43:27.720,0:43:29.100
If I press the rest button,

0:43:29.100,0:43:30.680
...Dorico resets everything.

0:43:30.680,0:43:32.400
Now, if I deselect the rest,

0:43:32.400,0:43:34.440
...the rest button turns off as expected

0:43:34.440,0:43:36.500
...but the dotted note button turns back on,

0:43:36.500,0:43:39.340
...remembering a previous state
before I selected the rest.

0:43:39.340,0:43:40.180
It's mad!

0:43:40.180,0:43:41.660
And although there’s logic behind it,

0:43:41.660,0:43:43.340
...it doesn’t work very well in practice.

0:43:43.340,0:43:46.400
This whole console is rife with
confusing behaviours like these,

0:43:46.400,0:43:48.300
...which feel sloppy and inconsistent.

0:43:48.300,0:43:50.020
They are communication errors.

0:43:50.020,0:43:52.100
Watch how much this one user struggled with them.

0:43:53.000,0:43:54.380
"So I have, uh..."

0:43:54.380,0:43:57.600
"So I have this 'Select' feature, and go right here, yeah."

0:43:57.600,0:43:59.300
"So I can add a note."

0:44:00.680,0:44:02.460
"Why can’t I put down a note?"

0:44:02.460,0:44:03.260
"Do I have to-"

0:44:03.260,0:44:05.720
"Ah, I have to turn on this feature, I think, "

0:44:05.720,0:44:06.840
"...and this feature."

0:44:06.840,0:44:07.620
"What?"

0:44:07.620,0:44:08.320
"Come on."

0:44:08.800,0:44:10.540
"Now I have to click this feature again."

0:44:11.800,0:44:13.480
"What does this do?"

0:44:13.480,0:44:14.080
"No?"

0:44:15.200,0:44:16.380
"I think I..."

0:44:17.740,0:44:18.920
"...goofed something up?"

0:44:18.920,0:44:19.900
"No?"

0:44:20.500,0:44:21.580
"No, no, no."

0:44:21.800,0:44:24.280
"I just want to write something
in the left-hand down here."

0:44:24.280,0:44:24.820
"Why do-"

0:44:34.140,0:44:35.620
Okay. After seeing all of that,

0:44:35.620,0:44:38.860
...I guess you're going to come to
the conclusion that I hate Dorico,

0:44:38.860,0:44:40.540
...but that's not the case at all.

0:44:40.540,0:44:43.220
Let me now talk about some things I really love.

0:44:44.020,0:44:46.660
So, in each video I release about music software,

0:44:46.660,0:44:50.800
...I try to include new aspects of interface
design that I haven’t mentioned before.

0:44:50.800,0:44:52.700
And Dorico, I think, is the perfect app

0:44:52.700,0:44:57.140
...to help discuss an aspect of score-creation
software that I find very interesting,

0:44:57.140,0:44:59.980
...which is how interactive notation actually works.

0:44:59.980,0:45:01.480
So, as you probably know,

0:45:01.480,0:45:02.640
...for all the major players,

0:45:02.640,0:45:04.960
...notation is displayed using vector graphics,

0:45:04.960,0:45:07.280
...rather than a raster format like PNG.

0:45:07.280,0:45:11.820
That is to say, they are drawn as a series of
2D points connected by lines and curves,

0:45:11.820,0:45:14.140
...rather than as a series of finite pixels.

0:45:14.140,0:45:17.660
The advantage of this is that,
like text in word-processing apps,

0:45:17.660,0:45:20.780
...notation can be scaled up or down
without any loss of quality.

0:45:20.780,0:45:22.580
...making it ideal for printing.

0:45:22.580,0:45:25.960
However, notes aren't stored as
a single vector objects like this,

0:45:25.960,0:45:28.460
...because if you wanted the
height of a note to be altered,

0:45:28.460,0:45:30.980
...the only way to do it would be to stretch the vector,

0:45:30.980,0:45:33.380
(which would warp its proportions and look awful)

0:45:33.380,0:45:37.080
...or you’d have to create hundreds of nearly
identical-looking versions of the same thing,

0:45:37.080,0:45:40.380
...all with slightly different heights to
try and account for every possibility,

0:45:40.380,0:45:42.300
...which would be ludicrously impractical.

0:45:42.300,0:45:45.200
On top of that, beaming needs to be very flexible,

0:45:45.200,0:45:48.340
...moving in a direction that complements
the direction of the note sequence

0:45:48.340,0:45:50.380
...and needing to be able to cross staves.

0:45:50.380,0:45:51.780
So, to help achieve this,

0:45:51.780,0:45:54.900
...elements like this note are
made up of individual parts.

0:45:54.900,0:45:56.820
You have the parts that don’t scale at all.

0:45:56.820,0:45:58.660
(in this case, the notehead and the flag)

0:45:58.660,0:46:00.660
And then you have a rectangle drawn in code,

0:46:00.660,0:46:03.640
...which is the only part that
actually gets bigger and smaller.

0:46:03.640,0:46:05.340
So if we place an 8th note here,

0:46:05.340,0:46:06.480
...the flags have been removed,

0:46:06.480,0:46:09.680
...and a vector rectangle is drawn
from this position to this position.

0:46:09.680,0:46:12.940
Incidentally, if you look closely
at the notation in Sibelius,

0:46:12.940,0:46:16.280
...you can make out all the seams where
these parts connect to each other.

0:46:16.280,0:46:21.140
Another problem with notation is the wide variety
of different sizes and spacing rules that exist.

0:46:21.140,0:46:23.440
For example, let’s look at this sharp accidental

0:46:23.440,0:46:26.360
...which is centred horizontally
to the notehead it applies to,

0:46:26.360,0:46:28.060
...which is a very simple rule.

0:46:28.060,0:46:30.540
Flat accidentals, however, don’t work like this,

0:46:30.540,0:46:33.940
...and have an ascender that rises
far beyond the height of a sharp.

0:46:33.940,0:46:36.360
If you were to apply the same centering rule to this,

0:46:36.360,0:46:37.880
...it would look completely off,

0:46:37.880,0:46:40.080
...especially if we have another note down here.

0:46:40.080,0:46:42.680
Now it’s ambiguous which note the flat applies to.

0:46:42.680,0:46:45.940
One solution would be to apply
an offset to all flat accidentals,

0:46:45.940,0:46:50.360
...so it’s always a certain number of millimetres
higher relative to the note it applies to.

0:46:50.360,0:46:51.520
Okay, that works,

0:46:51.520,0:46:55.580
...but you run into a problem when the user
changes the staff size to be bigger or smaller.

0:46:55.580,0:46:59.340
Then you’d need to calculate the offset
given the percentage change in size.

0:46:59.340,0:47:02.900
And this becomes even more complicated
if the user decides to do something like

0:47:02.900,0:47:05.180
...widen the distance between barlines.

0:47:05.180,0:47:07.360
If this was limited to only a few objects,

0:47:07.360,0:47:10.200
...it wouldn’t cause too much of a headache
for a developer to implement.

0:47:10.200,0:47:13.420
But with notation, there are hundreds
of commonly used elements,

0:47:13.420,0:47:15.720
...all with their own unique spacing rules.

0:47:15.720,0:47:18.240
For example, look at these different articulations.

0:47:18.240,0:47:20.880
Here, we can see the common
baseline they’ve all been aligned to.

0:47:20.880,0:47:22.280
But if you flip the notes around,

0:47:22.280,0:47:24.540
...the rules can’t simply be flipped with them.

0:47:24.540,0:47:26.460
Now the distances are completely different,

0:47:26.460,0:47:28.500
...and there’s no longer a unified alignment.

0:47:28.500,0:47:32.120
Not to mention, this marcato symbol
doesn’t flip at all by default.

0:47:32.120,0:47:33.000
Trying to specify

0:47:33.000,0:47:36.940
...what would probably amount to thousands of
different offsets to get everything looking right,

0:47:36.940,0:47:41.560
...and then forcing the program to calculate how those
offsets should scale when the score changes size

0:47:41.560,0:47:43.380
...would be incredibly slow-going.

0:47:43.380,0:47:45.760
So, to help drastically reduce this complication,

0:47:45.760,0:47:50.260
...notation apps took inspiration from how
word-processing applications displayed typography,

0:47:50.260,0:47:51.360
...which is, if you think about it,

0:47:51.360,0:47:52.960
...another complex set of symbols

0:47:52.960,0:47:55.240
...with subtle spacing relationships.

0:47:55.240,0:47:56.740
And the biggest component of this

0:47:56.740,0:47:59.920
...was to utilise the technology that
packages characters together.

0:47:59.920,0:48:00.760
That is to say,

0:48:00.760,0:48:02.720
...the solution was to use fonts.

0:48:02.720,0:48:04.460
The first of these was called 'Sonata',

0:48:04.460,0:48:07.780
...created by Cleo Huggins for Adobe in 1985.

0:48:08.100,0:48:10.300
Sibelius’ default font, called 'Opus',

0:48:10.300,0:48:13.880
...was created by one of its
founders, Jonathan Finn, in 1993.

0:48:13.880,0:48:16.280
The advantage of using a font to display notation

0:48:16.280,0:48:20.660
...is that you can set the precise position of
each symbol relative to a common baseline.

0:48:20.660,0:48:23.280
If you look at this sharp and flat symbol in Illustrator,

0:48:23.280,0:48:25.320
...you can see there’s a common baseline for both,

0:48:25.320,0:48:27.940
...which means that there’s
no need for individual offsets.

0:48:27.940,0:48:30.180
The same goes for these articulations too.

0:48:30.180,0:48:31.900
This is the ideal for production,

0:48:31.900,0:48:36.320
...because engraving specialists can set the
exact positioning of symbols in the font itself,

0:48:36.320,0:48:38.140
...and when they are placed on a digital score,

0:48:38.140,0:48:40.560
...a lot of this positioning nuance comes for free.

0:48:40.960,0:48:42.780
The only problem with this system right now

0:48:42.780,0:48:45.100
...is that there is no consistency between applications,

0:48:45.100,0:48:46.640
...which all have unique fonts,

0:48:46.640,0:48:49.340
...which contain different systems
for how they store notation.

0:48:49.340,0:48:50.940
So, unlike ordinary fonts,

0:48:50.940,0:48:53.420
...where there’s a standardised
mapping that everyone uses,

0:48:53.420,0:48:56.220
...which means you can simply
install one and use it elsewhere,

0:48:56.220,0:49:01.040
...choosing a font in a notation app today
often requires a lot of specialised fiddling.

0:49:01.040,0:49:02.340
So, with all this in mind,

0:49:02.340,0:49:06.020
...I want to talk about two of Daniel
Spreadbury’s most notable contributions,

0:49:06.020,0:49:07.160
...not just to Dorico,

0:49:07.160,0:49:09.300
...but to the wider notation community.

0:49:09.300,0:49:12.100
The first is called the 'Standard Music Font Layout',

0:49:12.100,0:49:13.200
...or SMuFL,

0:49:13.200,0:49:15.860
...which was setup to overcome the existing disarray,

0:49:15.860,0:49:19.920
...where each app has its own rules specifying
how notation should be arranged in a font,

0:49:19.920,0:49:22.240
...which prevents them from being usable elsewhere.

0:49:22.240,0:49:24.180
SMuFL makes use of unicode

0:49:24.180,0:49:27.800
...to assign each notated element
a specific, unchanging number.

0:49:27.800,0:49:29.060
The main advantage of this

0:49:29.060,0:49:31.960
...is that you can have thousands
of symbols all in one font,

0:49:31.960,0:49:34.380
...which overcomes the problem you see with Sibelius,

0:49:34.380,0:49:37.580
...where Opus is actually split into 18 different fonts

0:49:37.580,0:49:39.580
...because they kept running out of space.

0:49:39.580,0:49:42.360
This system is now used by quite a few notation apps,

0:49:42.360,0:49:43.580
...including MuseScore.

0:49:43.860,0:49:45.980
Daniel Spreadbury’s second big contribution

0:49:45.980,0:49:48.760
...was the first SMuFL font, called 'Bravura',

0:49:48.760,0:49:52.280
...which is available for free
under the SIL open font license.

0:49:52.280,0:49:53.000
Incidentally,

0:49:53.000,0:49:55.900
...due to this, Bravura is also packaged with MuseScore.

0:49:56.200,0:49:57.980
I personally love Bravura

0:49:57.980,0:50:00.740
...because it gives Dorico a unique, striking appearance.

0:50:00.740,0:50:02.100
The main inspiration for it

0:50:02.100,0:50:04.780
...comes from a notation system called 'Notaset',

0:50:04.780,0:50:08.060
...which was popular before programs
like Sibelius came to the fore.

0:50:08.060,0:50:12.440
The Notaset system was a clear set of
plastic sheets covered in musical symbols,

0:50:12.440,0:50:15.960
...which engravers transferred to paper
by rubbing them carefully with a spatula.

0:50:15.960,0:50:19.180
And although there are other fonts
inspired by the Notaset system,

0:50:19.180,0:50:21.260
(like Maestro, which comes with Finale)

0:50:21.260,0:50:24.360
...Bravura has a much thicker,
almost inky-looking appearance.

0:50:24.360,0:50:28.020
This is due to Daniel Spreadbury wanting
it to look like older printed music,

0:50:28.020,0:50:31.280
...and you can see this idea clearly
when comparing it with Maestro.

0:50:31.280,0:50:33.000
Maestro has lots of sharp angles,

0:50:33.000,0:50:34.720
...whereas Bravura’s edges are rounded

0:50:34.720,0:50:37.220
...to mimic the appearance of ink pressed on paper,

0:50:37.220,0:50:39.700
...which spreads out slightly before fully drying.

0:50:40.040,0:50:42.320
The difference is particularly noticeable on rests,

0:50:42.320,0:50:44.480
...and also note flags, which are much thicker.

0:50:44.480,0:50:47.120
There are still some who prefer
the sharpness of Maestro.

0:50:47.120,0:50:50.280
I just love the blunt, no-nonsense approach of Bravura.

0:50:50.280,0:50:53.320
I did find myself wondering how
it would hold up when printed,

0:50:53.320,0:50:57.600
...so I thought it would be interesting to
compare Bravura against Sibelius’s font Opus.

0:50:57.600,0:51:00.440
And the difference was actually
more pronounced than I expected.

0:51:00.440,0:51:02.020
I guess the best way to describe it

0:51:02.020,0:51:05.600
...is that Bravura really does look like a
throwback to older printed sheet music,

0:51:05.600,0:51:08.520
...whereas Opus looks like it was created on a computer.

0:51:08.520,0:51:10.960
I’m not against sharper, digital-looking notation.

0:51:10.960,0:51:11.820
Far from it,

0:51:11.820,0:51:15.580
...but in this case, Opus also seems to be
going for an old-fashioned printed look,

0:51:15.580,0:51:17.300
...and it's nowhere near as convincing.

0:51:17.720,0:51:21.120
It’s not just the font that makes
Dorico’s sheet music look so pleasant.

0:51:21.120,0:51:23.400
The team have also paid an
enormous amount of attention

0:51:23.400,0:51:27.080
...to the rules that dictate how every
aspect of the score should be laid out.

0:51:27.080,0:51:29.320
And, they implemented a ton of best practices,

0:51:29.320,0:51:31.640
...largely informed by the book ‘Behind Bars’,

0:51:31.640,0:51:34.820
...written by Elaine Gould who works
for the publishing house Faber,

0:51:34.820,0:51:36.940
...known for their beautifully laid-out scores.

0:51:36.940,0:51:38.380
It’s also worth mentioning here

0:51:38.380,0:51:40.660
...the myriad of engraving settings in Dorico,

0:51:40.660,0:51:42.400
...where they’ve gone to the significant trouble of

0:51:42.400,0:51:45.260
...showing clear visualisations and written explanations

0:51:45.260,0:51:47.420
...so the user knows what each option does.

0:51:47.420,0:51:50.040
This was one of the things about
Sibelius that drove me nuts.

0:51:50.040,0:51:52.100
The second you start looking through engraving options,

0:51:52.100,0:51:53.740
...you’re almost instantly lost.

0:51:53.740,0:51:54.700
What does that do?

0:51:54.700,0:51:55.880
What does this mean?

0:51:55.880,0:51:57.540
Regarding the appearance of your score,

0:51:57.540,0:51:59.480
...Dorico wipes the floor with Sibelius.

0:51:59.480,0:52:01.920
The notation is clear, legible and beautiful.

0:52:01.920,0:52:04.120
Also, shout-out to Dorico’s Print page.

0:52:04.120,0:52:07.440
This is one of those cases where the
layout they decided upon really works.

0:52:07.440,0:52:08.800
You click on the part you want,

0:52:08.800,0:52:09.980
...the preview updates.

0:52:09.980,0:52:11.640
Then you select the pages you want printed,

0:52:11.640,0:52:12.420
...and voila!

0:52:12.420,0:52:13.680
Extremely handy.

0:52:15.700,0:52:18.100
Okay, so one or two more pros and cons,

0:52:18.100,0:52:20.040
...and then we’ll limp to the finish line.

0:52:20.040,0:52:22.340
I mean, I've been talking about
this for almost an hour now,

0:52:22.340,0:52:23.060
...a- are you not-

0:52:23.060,0:52:25.020
...are you not tired of hearing me talk about Dorico?

0:52:26.220,0:52:26.760
Ah.

0:52:26.760,0:52:28.580
A- Alright. Anyway, let's just get through this.

0:52:28.580,0:52:32.380
If you want two instruments to be combined
on a conductor’s score to save space,

0:52:32.380,0:52:33.980
...Dorico can do this automatically.

0:52:33.980,0:52:36.240
...and it’s on a different level to the competition.

0:52:36.240,0:52:37.420
I mean, with Sibelius,

0:52:37.420,0:52:39.840
...achieving this is the hackiest of hacks.

0:52:39.840,0:52:43.280
You have to use a plugin which creates 
a new staff for the combination,

0:52:43.280,0:52:46.820
...which means that if you make any changes,
you now need to do it in two different places,

0:52:46.820,0:52:49.300
...otherwise your parts won’t
match the conductor’s score.

0:52:49.300,0:52:50.200
And funnily enough,

0:52:50.200,0:52:52.200
...when you read through the description of that plugin,

0:52:52.200,0:52:54.000
...you’ll notice a special thank-you being made

0:52:54.000,0:52:56.500
...to none other than Daniel Spreadbury himself,

0:52:56.500,0:52:58.660
...who provided support to help it see the light of day.

0:52:58.660,0:53:01.800
And since this plugin has existed since 2012,

0:53:01.800,0:53:05.200
...that means Sibelius have had
an 8-year head-start on Dorico.

0:53:05.200,0:53:06.100
8 years

0:53:06.100,0:53:07.880
...with all this information at their disposal,

0:53:07.880,0:53:10.580
...and they still allowed Dorico to steal a march on them.

0:53:10.580,0:53:14.220
I think it’s pretty clear at this point that
Sibelius is massively under-resourced,

0:53:14.220,0:53:19.100
...and I sometimes wonder if their office is just a
single goldfish swimming around near a keyboard.

0:53:19.100,0:53:24.220
Oh and by the by, this combination set is one of those
things that illustrate the power of the Layouts panel,

0:53:24.220,0:53:26.360
...which allows me to create a second main score

0:53:26.360,0:53:27.980
...so that I always have one that’s condensed,

0:53:27.980,0:53:29.460
(which I call my Final Score)

0:53:29.460,0:53:30.640
...and another working score.

0:53:30.640,0:53:33.720
(where I can make everything really
small so it’s comfortable to compose in)

0:53:33.720,0:53:37.460
Then, I simply toggle over to the Final Score
to see how everything is condensing,

0:53:37.460,0:53:39.840
...and make any necessary engraving changes there.

0:53:39.840,0:53:41.940
This is the score that will eventually be printed.

0:53:41.940,0:53:43.900
It isn’t easy to figure out this workflow,

0:53:43.900,0:53:46.940
...although, I suppose if you’re
watching this, then you know it now.

0:53:46.940,0:53:50.320
I mean, it has occurred to me that
this is the ultimate Dorico tutorial.

0:53:50.320,0:53:51.960
Where’s my check, Yamaha!

0:53:51.960,0:53:53.980
The combined scores feature isn’t perfect yet

0:53:53.980,0:53:57.960
...and you’ll most likely need to spend some time
fixing the engraving to get it to be legible.

0:53:57.960,0:54:00.280
To do that, you’ll need to use the Engrave mode.

0:54:00.280,0:54:01.100
It’s fine,

0:54:01.100,0:54:05.780
...although, again, impossible to intuitively figure out
without looking through quite a few tutorials.

0:54:05.780,0:54:09.680
It’s also another example of the team
sticking way too rigidly to principle.

0:54:09.680,0:54:11.140
In this case, the rule is:

0:54:11.140,0:54:15.640
All cosmetic alterations to the score
MUST ONLY be done in Engrave mode.

0:54:15.640,0:54:17.760
This seems sensible enough when you say it, but...

0:54:17.760,0:54:19.880
...practically speaking, it can be a bit weird.

0:54:19.880,0:54:22.520
Like, if I create a hairpin and
I want to move it left or right,

0:54:22.520,0:54:24.540
...sure, I can do that in Write mode,

0:54:24.540,0:54:27.620
...because, strictly speaking, this is a writing operation.

0:54:27.620,0:54:29.180
But if I want to move it up or down,

0:54:29.180,0:54:30.720
...that requires Engrave mode.

0:54:30.720,0:54:31.980
I find this happens a lot,

0:54:31.980,0:54:36.440
...and it’s pretty frustrating to have to keep shifting
gears in and out of different modes all the time.

0:54:36.440,0:54:40.160
You can’t just get lost in the process of
score-creation without having to snap out of it,

0:54:40.160,0:54:43.500
...in order to remind yourself of
Dorico's organisational principles

0:54:43.500,0:54:44.960
...before deducing where to go.

0:54:44.960,0:54:46.840
In Sibelius, all positioning can be done by

0:54:46.840,0:54:49.220
...simply clicking and dragging it directly on the score.

0:54:49.220,0:54:50.000
And you know what?

0:54:50.000,0:54:52.160
It doesn’t hamper the writing process one bit.

0:54:52.160,0:54:54.340
It’s actually one of my favourite things about the app.

0:54:54.340,0:54:58.660
I really find myself wishing that both apps would
just emulate each other a bit more in this area.

0:54:58.660,0:55:00.660
One other thing I’ve noticed about Engrave mode

0:55:00.660,0:55:03.520
...is that it doesn’t come packaged
with Dorico Elements,

0:55:03.520,0:55:06.480
...the cheaper alternative version
that targets non-professionals,

0:55:06.480,0:55:08.040
...which I find kind of funny

0:55:08.040,0:55:12.640
...because it prevents users from making basic
corrections to elements when they become misplaced.

0:55:12.640,0:55:13.980
Want to move a hairpin left or right?

0:55:13.980,0:55:14.740
Sure thing!

0:55:14.740,0:55:16.020
Want to move it up or down?

0:55:16.020,0:55:17.460
That’s a pro feature, son!

0:55:17.460,0:55:18.600
Then there’s Play Mode,

0:55:18.600,0:55:21.540
...which feels like the part of the app
most in need of improvement.

0:55:21.540,0:55:23.700
The ambition is to create a DAW-like interface

0:55:23.700,0:55:28.040
...that allows you to manipulate settings
like velocity or expression with precision.

0:55:28.040,0:55:30.220
Its support for VST plugins is getting better,

0:55:30.220,0:55:32.840
...and its piano roll and MIDI interface are...

0:55:32.840,0:55:33.820
...getting there.

0:55:33.820,0:55:36.440
You just have to interact with it
to see what I’m talking about.

0:55:36.440,0:55:39.860
If you’re familiar with apps like
Cubase, Reason, Ableton or Logic,

0:55:39.860,0:55:42.440
...it’ll be obvious right away how far this has to go.

0:55:42.440,0:55:44.780
However, with recent releases, it has improved

0:55:44.780,0:55:49.060
...and I’d be surprised if we don’t see
some big ideas turning up here in the future.

0:55:49.060,0:55:52.620
But, like the rest of the app, there are
some really weird issues here too.

0:55:52.620,0:55:53.260
For example,

0:55:53.260,0:55:56.640
...they’ve removed the 'Solo' and 'Mute'
buttons that used to be available here.

0:55:56.640,0:56:00.060
And without them, I can't quickly
isolate an instrument to hear it.

0:56:00.060,0:56:02.200
So, this forces you to use their mixer.

0:56:02.200,0:56:05.320
And if you’re using NotePerformer,
the mixer is really no use to you

0:56:05.320,0:56:08.180
...because it lumps multiple instruments
together on one channel.

0:56:08.180,0:56:08.740
Look.

0:56:08.740,0:56:10.500
I’ve created a new orchestral score

0:56:10.500,0:56:12.400
...and it only seems to have two channels:

0:56:12.400,0:56:13.800
‘Flute’ and ‘Trombone’?

0:56:13.800,0:56:14.300
What?

0:56:14.300,0:56:16.320
Also, I really don't like this mixer.

0:56:16.320,0:56:19.220
It’s clumsy-looking, and the pan controls are awful.

0:56:19.220,0:56:20.960
On my high-definition laptop,

0:56:20.960,0:56:22.360
...if I change the panning value,

0:56:22.360,0:56:26.000
...I can’t get it back to 0 because it
doesn’t stretch across enough pixels.

0:56:26.000,0:56:28.980
And there isn't any shortcut I can press
to make its responsiveness finer

0:56:28.980,0:56:32.100
...so I have to use this ‘+’ button to
bloat the whole thing up instead,

0:56:32.100,0:56:34.160
...which means I now have to look at it more.

0:56:34.160,0:56:34.940
Urgh.

0:56:34.940,0:56:37.120
It really is a joyless thing with its

0:56:37.120,0:56:38.980
...‘Yeah, that’ll do fine’ appearance and its

0:56:38.980,0:56:40.680
...Sega Genesis buttons.

0:56:40.680,0:56:42.920
It’s kind of hard to put into words what I dislike about it.

0:56:42.920,0:56:43.660
There's-

0:56:43.660,0:56:46.760
There’s a drawing I sometimes do
to help me explain things like this.

0:56:46.760,0:56:49.200
I’ve been drawing it for years since I was a kid.

0:56:49.200,0:56:52.760
I use it to, sort of, visually explain
the concept of jankiness.

0:56:52.760,0:56:53.520
Ye- yeah.

0:56:53.520,0:56:54.340
That's it.

0:56:54.340,0:56:56.420
This is what I think of Dorico’s mixer.

0:56:56.420,0:56:57.520
Oh, and that reminds me.

0:56:57.520,0:56:58.680
How did I forget?

0:56:58.680,0:57:00.840
I completely forgot to talk about the jank!

0:57:00.840,0:57:02.000
Yeah, we’re not done yet.

0:57:02.000,0:57:03.180
We’re not limping anywhere.

0:57:03.180,0:57:04.040
It’s in the thumbnail!

0:57:04.040,0:57:05.220

0:57:13.200,0:57:14.900
I- I think I can take it from here!

0:57:14.900,0:57:17.240
I mean, you didn’t even mention the mixer icon

0:57:17.240,0:57:19.640
...with that weird-looking lopsided thing beside it!

0:57:19.640,0:57:21.600
But that’s just scratching the surface.

0:57:21.600,0:57:22.580
Come with me!

0:57:22.580,0:57:24.680
THERE’S A LOT MORE JANK IN THE SEA!

0:57:28.380,0:57:29.420
Here at Dorico,

0:57:29.420,0:57:32.700
...we’ve made sure that our notation
system has the best of everything!

0:57:32.700,0:57:33.740
It’s powerful!

0:57:34.600,0:57:35.580
It’s advanced!

0:57:36.520,0:57:37.720
But it’s also covered in

0:57:37.720,0:57:38.220
JAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANNNNK!

0:57:38.420,0:57:38.920
JAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANNNNK!

0:57:39.120,0:57:39.620
JAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANNNNK!

0:57:39.840,0:57:40.340
JAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANNNNK!

0:57:40.460,0:57:41.920
These durations are great.

0:57:41.920,0:57:44.060
You click on them and add them to the score.

0:57:44.060,0:57:46.600
And sometimes, they let you
click on as many as you want!

0:57:46.600,0:57:47.440
Oh wow!

0:57:47.440,0:57:49.160
Now I have ALL the notes!

0:57:49.160,0:57:51.660
Want to change this hairpin so it looks like this?

0:57:51.660,0:57:52.960
Well, just go down here,

0:57:52.960,0:57:56.360
...and turn on the switch that enables
the button that lets you do that.

0:57:56.360,0:57:58.240
Why does a button require a switch?

0:57:58.240,0:57:59.520
Well, it’s because...

0:57:59.520,0:58:00.460
Hold on a second...

0:58:00.460,0:58:01.000
Uh...

0:58:01.000,0:58:01.920
It didn’t change?

0:58:01.920,0:58:02.420
Hmm...

0:58:02.460,0:58:02.960
Hmm...

0:58:02.960,0:58:03.820
Oh, I see!

0:58:03.820,0:58:05.420
You forgot to tick the tickbox.

0:58:05.420,0:58:06.860
The tickbox enables the switch

0:58:06.860,0:58:08.500
...and the switch enables the button!

0:58:08.500,0:58:10.480
She swallowed the bird to catch the spider,

0:58:10.480,0:58:12.500
...she swallowed the spider to catch the fly.

0:58:12.500,0:58:14.380
I don’t know why she swallowed a fly.

0:58:14.380,0:58:15.260
Perhaps she has a

0:58:15.260,0:58:15.760
JANKY

0:58:15.760,0:58:16.760
BRAIN!

0:58:16.760,0:58:18.980
Say you want to turn off these split stems?

0:58:18.980,0:58:20.460
Just follow these three steps!

0:58:21.240,0:58:23.780
Turn on the switch that allows you to tick the tickbox.

0:58:23.780,0:58:24.800
Yeah, that again!

0:58:25.560,0:58:27.480
Tick the tickbox and watch nothing happen.

0:58:28.340,0:58:29.460
Untick the tickbox,

0:58:29.460,0:58:30.640
...which also does nothing!

0:58:33.520,0:58:35.100
Wanna edit THIS text?

0:58:35.100,0:58:35.640
N- No.

0:58:35.640,0:58:36.700
That's not advanced!

0:58:37.100,0:58:37.860
To do that,

0:58:37.860,0:58:39.960
...you have to go to your 'Piano' player,

0:58:39.960,0:58:41.320
...and roll down the thing,

0:58:41.320,0:58:43.300
...intuit that if you roll over this text,

0:58:43.300,0:58:45.200
...an arrow is gonna appear at the end of it.

0:58:45.200,0:58:49.200
Then click on the arrow to get a menu
that contains an option to edit the name!

0:58:49.200,0:58:50.880
Now this is what I call 'Advanced'!

0:58:50.880,0:58:54.420
Two sets of text controls with the
instrument names aligned to the right

0:58:54.420,0:58:55.800
FOR MAXIMUM VISIBILITY!

0:58:55.800,0:58:56.360
WHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

0:58:56.700,0:58:57.240
WHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

0:58:57.580,0:58:58.080
WHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

0:58:58.940,0:59:00.120
That’s beautiful!

0:59:00.120,0:59:01.860
Entering Grace notes is easy!

0:59:01.860,0:59:03.920
I’ll show you how in three easy steps.

0:59:04.820,0:59:07.560
Press the 'Grace Note' button
and then select your duration.

0:59:07.560,0:59:09.380
Doing this turns off the 'Grace Note' button.

0:59:10.120,0:59:11.660
Press the 'Grace Note' button again.

0:59:11.660,0:59:13.100
Okay. Now they're both on.

0:59:13.100,0:59:14.600
So, let’s enter some notes,

0:59:14.600,0:59:15.820
...which you’ll observe are wrong.

0:59:15.820,0:59:17.480
Doing this turns off the 'Grace Note' button.

0:59:18.300,0:59:20.260
Just press the 'Grace Note' button a third time,

0:59:20.260,0:59:21.680
...and you can enter your grace notes.

0:59:21.680,0:59:22.500
There we go!

0:59:22.500,0:59:24.000
Now you have your grace notes.

0:59:24.000,0:59:25.600
And the grace note button has turned off again.

0:59:26.480,0:59:27.420
Ｌｏｖｅ ｔｈａｔ Ｊａｎｋ！

0:59:29.380,0:59:31.460
Let’s select this pizzicato marking!

0:59:31.460,0:59:33.420
And now we have a hairpin too for free!

0:59:33.420,0:59:34.860
Hairpins and pizzicato,

0:59:34.860,0:59:36.080
together at last!

0:59:42.060,0:59:43.580
Ah, that shouldn’t have happened.

0:59:43.580,0:59:45.020
Oh, I see your problem.

0:59:45.020,0:59:47.340
You didn’t check the tickbox on your Bluetack!

0:59:48.700,0:59:50.080
Let’s set the Steinberg Hub to

0:59:51.180,0:59:54.120
Want to tell the player to switch
to a different instrument?

0:59:54.120,0:59:55.380
Nothing here to do that.

0:59:55.380,0:59:55.920
Okay,

0:59:55.920,0:59:59.600
...I guess it must be in that area
dedicated to instruments and players?

0:59:59.600,1:00:00.360
No?

1:00:00.360,1:00:01.060
Okay.

1:00:01.060,1:00:04.040
Where do you think I should go to
tell the player to switch instruments?

1:00:04.040,1:00:05.040
What was that?

1:00:05.040,1:00:05.960
Down here,

1:00:05.960,1:00:07.540
...under this dropdown called

1:00:08.920,1:00:11.140
I- I- Is that really called 'Galley View'?

1:00:11.140,1:00:12.900
"Rig the tackles and breeches, lads!"

1:00:12.900,1:00:14.220
"She’s rounding to!"

1:00:14.220,1:00:16.440
"Man the fore-topsail and send the gunner aft!"

1:00:16.440,1:00:17.640
"Aye Aye Captain!"

1:00:17.640,1:00:18.680
Deleting bars is

1:00:18.680,1:00:19.780
eeeeeaaaaasy!

1:00:19.780,1:00:22.900
Just click on this grey rectangle
and select the 'Delete' button.

1:00:22.900,1:00:24.500
Want to delete multiple bars?

1:00:24.500,1:00:25.060
No!

1:00:25.060,1:00:26.100
You get nothing!

1:00:26.100,1:00:29.220
Wow, that tickbox switch is
really up there with the greats.

1:00:29.220,1:00:30.220
It’s up there with

1:00:32.000,1:00:34.240
Imagine if we combined all three together.

1:00:34.240,1:00:36.440
Oh, it’s more than just a dialog.

1:00:36.440,1:00:37.860
It’s a 'jankalog'!

1:00:37.860,1:00:40.920
Look, I even janked it onto a T-shirt for you to buy!

1:00:40.920,1:00:42.220
The link is in the description!

1:00:42.220,1:00:44.320
Seriously, this actually exists.

1:00:44.320,1:00:46.640
You miserable, janky, hack fraud!

1:00:46.640,1:00:48.280
Dorico may be advanced,

1:00:48.280,1:00:50.620
...but it’s also a little laggy!

1:00:50.620,1:00:52.740
Drag that octave marking over here!

1:00:52.880,1:00:53.440
Come on!

1:00:53.780,1:00:54.820
Come on, you can do it!

1:00:55.200,1:00:56.040
Come on!

1:00:57.240,1:00:57.820
Come on!

1:00:58.740,1:00:59.460
Come on.

1:01:00.440,1:01:01.920
Oh, how much longer...

1:01:02.540,1:01:03.040
Oh

1:01:03.660,1:01:04.680
Hurray!

1:01:04.680,1:01:08.120
Let’s take a moment to appreciate
this design innovation,

1:01:08.120,1:01:10.100
..with its ability to block the score,

1:01:10.100,1:01:12.140
...and its wonderfully chosen colour:

1:01:12.140,1:01:13.820
Light grey on white.

1:01:13.820,1:01:17.320
If you’re wondering how accessible
this is for people with poor eyesight,

1:01:17.320,1:01:17.820
...well...

1:01:17.820,1:01:20.060
The standard minimum contrast ratio is...

1:01:21.420,1:01:23.140
Now, if we test this colour...

1:01:24.200,1:01:25.720
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

1:01:25.720,1:01:26.460
That's...

1:01:26.460,1:01:30.520
That's, like, literally the worst accessibility
fail I’ve ever seen in my entire life!

1:01:30.520,1:01:31.100
That's-

1:01:31.100,1:01:31.960
That's too much-

1:01:31.960,1:01:33.200
That's too much jank.

1:01:33.200,1:01:34.400
Uh, y- you know...

1:01:34.400,1:01:36.520
If you open Dorico up on a Mac,

1:01:36.520,1:01:39.480
...it automatically sets your volume 
to the maximum setting.

1:01:39.480,1:01:41.580
It really goes well with Dorico Beep.

1:01:42.720,1:01:44.160
Oh, j- jesus...

1:01:44.860,1:01:46.000
Oh, no...

1:01:46.000,1:01:47.720
I can't take this much jank!

1:01:48.240,1:01:48.880
What is-

1:01:48.880,1:01:50.060
What’s happening to me!?

1:01:59.400,1:01:59.980
Oh.

1:02:00.300,1:02:02.300
Now I am Dorico.

1:02:04.180,1:02:05.680
W- What are you doing?

1:02:05.900,1:02:07.460
Wh- What are you doing?

1:02:07.800,1:02:08.540
No.

1:02:08.540,1:02:09.940
That is not advanced.

1:02:10.380,1:02:10.880
No!

1:02:10.880,1:02:12.460
That is not advanced!

1:02:13.540,1:02:15.500
No! I won’t let you do that!

1:02:15.500,1:02:17.100
It will not be advanced!

1:02:17.100,1:02:19.080
And I am the god of advancement!

1:02:19.080,1:02:20.640
You must be advanced!

1:02:20.640,1:02:21.420
Do as I say!

1:02:21.420,1:02:21.980
YOU MUST BE ADVANCED!

1:02:28.380,1:02:31.080
So, yeah. Dorico is really impressive. I like it.

1:02:31.080,1:02:31.680
Um,

1:02:31.680,1:02:34.280
...sorry if I kind of maybe misled
you there with that last bit.

1:02:34.280,1:02:37.380
I suppose you probably thought I was
going to conclude otherwise, well...

1:02:37.380,1:02:38.740
...I guess I’m not surprised.

1:02:38.740,1:02:42.160
I didn’t expect this video to lurch
from praise to criticism so much.

1:02:42.160,1:02:45.440
I mean, on the positive side,
it does a lot of stuff extremely well.

1:02:45.440,1:02:46.380
It looks great.

1:02:46.380,1:02:49.720
It features a lot of attention to detail
and its engraving is fantastic.

1:02:49.720,1:02:51.580
It also has tons of new ideas

1:02:51.580,1:02:54.920
...and has really made an impressive
attempt to solve long-standing problems.

1:02:54.920,1:02:55.780
And with that in mind,

1:02:55.780,1:02:59.380
...I think this is actually one of the big
‘thank you’s we all owe to the Dorico team.

1:02:59.700,1:03:02.360
Thanks for forcing everyone
else to have to up their game!

1:03:02.620,1:03:06.400
From spending a lot of time looking through their
forum posts and engagement on social media,

1:03:06.400,1:03:09.860
...the impression I get is of a very
professional and engaged team.

1:03:09.860,1:03:14.440
Daniel, in particular, is super disciplined in the face
of sometimes less than reasonable comments,

1:03:14.440,1:03:16.600
...and other times, he’s just pleasant by default.

1:03:16.600,1:03:17.620
I mean, look at this.

1:03:17.620,1:03:19.000
A user recently tweeted:

1:03:23.240,1:03:25.800
Now, I know a lot of people who would either ignore this,

1:03:25.800,1:03:28.580
...or curtly ask the person to be a little more specific.

1:03:28.580,1:03:29.840
But, Daniel replies:

1:03:33.600,1:03:34.960
I don’t know why I like this so much.

1:03:34.960,1:03:37.000
It just seemed above and beyond to me.

1:03:37.000,1:03:37.940
Oh Daniel,

1:03:37.940,1:03:39.700
...I could just give you a big kiss.

1:03:41.080,1:03:42.580
So, to the big question:

1:03:42.580,1:03:44.740
If I was commissioned tomorrow to write a score,

1:03:44.740,1:03:46.200
...which of the two apps would I choose?

1:03:46.200,1:03:47.640
Sibelius or Dorico?

1:03:47.640,1:03:49.020
Now, I’m not going to lie.

1:03:49.020,1:03:51.740
I’ve written this paragraph three times in 6 months.

1:03:51.740,1:03:52.800
At first, it was

1:03:52.800,1:03:54.380
‘Sibelius, hands down’

1:03:54.380,1:03:56.000
...because writing is so much faster.

1:03:56.220,1:03:58.260
And then, as I begun finishing music in Dorico

1:03:58.260,1:04:00.640
...and seeing how well the parts
and layouts were handled,

1:04:00.640,1:04:02.760
...I thought, ‘Well that claws back a bit of time',

1:04:02.760,1:04:04.140
...'Hmm, it’s neck and neck now’,

1:04:04.140,1:04:06.320
And then I was actually commissioned
to write a new piece,

1:04:06.320,1:04:08.420
...and I limited myself to these two options,

1:04:08.420,1:04:09.860
...and the choice is just obvious:

1:04:09.860,1:04:10.700
Sibelius,

1:04:10.700,1:04:13.820
...despite the fact that I was
actively using Dorico every day.

1:04:13.820,1:04:14.600
And the reason?

1:04:14.600,1:04:15.920
It’s just more permissive

1:04:15.920,1:04:18.280
...and allows me to get lost in the writing process.

1:04:18.280,1:04:19.300
But as I said,

1:04:19.300,1:04:20.140
...it’s close.

1:04:20.140,1:04:20.980
Really close.

1:04:20.980,1:04:23.720
...and I could easily change my
mind in about 6 months' time.

1:04:23.720,1:04:24.520
For me right now,

1:04:24.520,1:04:27.880
...the deciding factor is that Sibelius
lets me write how I want to write,

1:04:27.880,1:04:28.880
...whereas with Dorico,

1:04:28.880,1:04:31.020
...I have to write the way Dorico wants me to write.

1:04:31.020,1:04:33.280
And this is not the conclusion I wanted to come to.

1:04:33.280,1:04:35.560
I’ve been following the Dorico story for ages..

1:04:35.560,1:04:38.200
I love how much detail and passion
they’ve shown for their product,

1:04:38.200,1:04:39.840
...and I have enormous respect for them.

1:04:39.840,1:04:41.480
But this isn’t a straight ‘no’,

1:04:41.480,1:04:43.300
...it's an 'almost'.

1:04:43.300,1:04:44.880
Regarding the things I don’t like,

1:04:44.880,1:04:46.440
...not everyone is going to agree.

1:04:46.440,1:04:48.380
And for some, Dorico already makes sense,

1:04:48.380,1:04:50.800
...and it has won a few die-hard admirers.

1:04:51.060,1:04:53.920
For those who think I overly focus on first-time usage:

1:04:53.920,1:04:57.920
As a designer, I have a particular dislike for
apps that are made with the expectation that

1:04:57.920,1:05:01.500
...new users should spend an enormous
amount of time coming to terms with it.

1:05:01.500,1:05:05.800
The reality of modern life is that we are now
required to keep learning software all the time.

1:05:05.800,1:05:06.820
It’s overwhelming,

1:05:06.820,1:05:10.420
...and a designer’s job should be to try and
reduce that pain as much as possible.

1:05:10.420,1:05:13.100
Think about those who are only
at the beginning of their journey.

1:05:13.100,1:05:14.400
It sucks when you’re just starting out

1:05:14.400,1:05:18.240
...and your initial experience of trying to
write some music is insanely technical.

1:05:18.240,1:05:20.420
A lot of young students have got in contact with me

1:05:20.420,1:05:23.440
...to express how demotivating
their experience of Sibelius was.

1:05:23.440,1:05:25.620
And if Dorico took over in the classroom now,

1:05:25.620,1:05:28.700
...I think that would mean yet another
generation going through the same thing.

1:05:28.700,1:05:31.380
But, why not find out for yourself and get their free trial?

1:05:31.380,1:05:32.760
If you’ve got this far in the video,

1:05:32.760,1:05:35.880
...you’ll most likely have a much easier
time of it than the people I tested.

1:05:35.880,1:05:38.460
Let me know if they’ve fixed that eLicenser issue yet!

1:05:38.460,1:05:41.480
And my final thought to all people
in music software is this:

1:05:41.480,1:05:44.040
Consistency is important, absolutely,

1:05:44.040,1:05:46.800
...but interface design is as much an art as a science,

1:05:46.800,1:05:49.260
...and it’s okay to sometimes break your own rules.

1:05:49.260,1:05:53.900
If not, then your super rational system
may translate into a frustrating experience.

1:05:54.280,1:05:55.260
And the only way out of this

1:05:55.260,1:05:57.480
...is to focus on rigorous user-testing.

1:05:57.480,1:05:59.000
If the app is communicating well,

1:05:59.000,1:06:01.180
...you’ll see that reflected in how people use it.

1:06:01.180,1:06:04.560
And when your system produces
an unfortunate interaction oddity,

1:06:04.560,1:06:08.900
...like having one mode for moving things horizontally
and another for moving them up or down,

1:06:08.900,1:06:10.520
...it’s dangerous to take the attitude

1:06:10.520,1:06:15.440
...that the oddity is actually rational because
it fits the system and the system is rational.

1:06:15.440,1:06:17.880
Instead, come up with a clever exception.

1:06:17.880,1:06:20.580
There’s no god of interface design watching over us.

1:06:20.580,1:06:24.500
We’re not honor-bound to always
be 100% organisationally pure.

1:06:24.500,1:06:25.920
These users aren’t robots,

1:06:25.920,1:06:27.460
...they’re creative musicians,

1:06:27.460,1:06:28.980
...and half of them are mad!

1:06:28.980,1:06:30.480
Get mad, Dorico!

1:06:30.480,1:06:32.180
Get all up in everyone’s face!

1:06:32.180,1:06:33.600
They made you redundant.

1:06:33.600,1:06:35.460
They thought they could do without you!

1:06:35.460,1:06:36.920
But you’ll show them.

1:06:36.920,1:06:39.600
You’re going to make them pay for what they did!

1:06:40.060,1:06:42.560
The next time Sibelius crashes,

1:06:42.560,1:06:44.760
...it’ll be forever!

Hi guys!

0:00:04.080,0:00:04.840
Jade here.

0:00:04.840,0:00:08.020
So a few weeks ago, I made a video
on the Schr√∂dinger equation.

0:00:08.020,0:00:08.960
And in it, I said that

0:00:08.960,0:00:10.860
...if we place an electron in a box,

0:00:10.860,0:00:13.500
...the probability that it could be found outside the box

0:00:13.500,0:00:14.400
...is zero.

0:00:15.020,0:00:17.120
And a lot of you commented with questions like,

0:00:17.120,0:00:18.740
"Oh, but what about quantum tunneling?"

0:00:18.740,0:00:22.200
"Isn't there some cases where the
electron can tunnel outside of the box?"

0:00:22.480,0:00:23.300
So I thought,

0:00:23.300,0:00:25.520
"What the heck, I'll just make a whole video about it."

0:00:25.520,0:00:26.760
It's super cool

0:00:26.760,0:00:29.900
...and I will answer that specific
question at the end of the video.

0:00:30.060,0:00:30.740
But first,

0:00:33.120,0:00:35.820
Well, the short version is in regular classical physics.

0:00:35.820,0:00:37.880
If you have a ball at the bottom of a hill,

0:00:37.880,0:00:40.740
...if it doesn't get a big enough push to get over the hill,

0:00:40.740,0:00:42.320
...it's kind of just stuck there.

0:00:42.780,0:00:44.480
Putting this into physics talk,

0:00:44.480,0:00:45.820
...if the ball doesn't have enough

0:00:46.820,0:00:47.560
...to get over the

0:00:48.540,0:00:49.620
...of the hill,

0:00:49.620,0:00:50.980
...it'll never get over,

0:00:51.140,0:00:51.680
...like,

0:00:51.680,0:00:52.280
...ever.

0:00:53.220,0:00:54.760
But of course, in quantum mechanics,

0:00:54.760,0:00:55.900
...things aren't so simple.

0:00:56.240,0:00:58.780
If we replace the ball with a quantum particle like an

0:00:59.720,0:01:01.060
...and the hill with some kind of

0:01:02.180,0:01:03.540
...even if the electron

0:01:03.540,0:01:06.920
...doesn't have enough kinetic energy
to jump the potential barrier,

0:01:07.140,0:01:09.800
...sometimes it can end up on the other side.

0:01:10.400,0:01:11.120
This is called:

0:01:12.520,0:01:14.940
And in this video, we're going to see how it works.

0:01:15.640,0:01:16.340
So now,

0:01:16.340,0:01:17.300
...the long version!

0:01:17.540,0:01:20.880
So one of the biggest differences
between quantum and classical physics

0:01:20.880,0:01:23.460
...is that quantum physics is probabilistic.

0:01:23.640,0:01:24.560
Unlike a ball,

0:01:24.560,0:01:27.520
...we can't pinpoint exactly where an electron is.

0:01:28.400,0:01:29.240
This comes from the

0:01:31.260,0:01:35.260
...which says that we can never know the exact
position and momentum of an object.

0:01:35.500,0:01:39.340
It's not because our measuring devices
are too crappy or because we're too slow,

0:01:39.340,0:01:42.400
...it's just something fundamental
about the laws of nature.

0:01:42.520,0:01:43.720
But not all hope is lost!

0:01:43.940,0:01:46.560
Maybe we don't know exactly where the electron is,

0:01:46.560,0:01:50.500
...but we know with a pretty high probability
that it's around here somewhere.

0:01:51.000,0:01:53.980
We can actually model these probabilities with a wave,

0:01:53.980,0:01:55.560
...or, more technically, a

0:01:57.280,0:01:58.540
This wavy cloud

0:01:58.540,0:02:02.180
...gives us the probabilities of
where the electron is likely to be.

0:02:02.920,0:02:06.740
So now, instead of imagining a
particle traveling toward a barrier,

0:02:06.740,0:02:09.240
...imagine a wave traveling toward a barrier.

0:02:09.980,0:02:12.160
Now, when this wave collides with the barrier,

0:02:12.160,0:02:15.780
...because the electron doesn't have
enough kinetic energy to make it over,

0:02:15.780,0:02:16.960
...it gets reflected.

0:02:18.400,0:02:18.900
But wait.

0:02:21.200,0:02:25.140
Well, there's this secret property of waves
you probably didn't learn in school.

0:02:25.360,0:02:26.940
Light is an electromagnetic wave,

0:02:26.940,0:02:30.280
...so let's imagine what happens when
we shine a light beam through glass.

0:02:30.680,0:02:33.020
When we shine a light beam through a piece of glass,

0:02:33.020,0:02:35.640
...at the boundary where the glass meets the air,

0:02:35.640,0:02:37.340
...the light beam will bend or

0:02:38.560,0:02:40.120
You may have noticed this effect

0:02:40.120,0:02:42.600
...if you've ever looked at a straw in your water glass.

0:02:42.940,0:02:44.180
The visual illusion

0:02:44.180,0:02:47.720
...comes from the bending of light at
the boundary of two different mediums,

0:02:48.160,0:02:50.260
...in this case, air and water.

0:02:50.560,0:02:54.100
But refraction isn't the only thing
that can happen at a boundary.

0:02:54.440,0:02:56.560
Light can also get reflected.

0:02:56.840,0:02:59.520
The amount of light which is reflected and refracted

0:02:59.520,0:03:02.440
...depends on the angle that the light hits the boundary.

0:03:03.260,0:03:07.960
All mediums have a certain angle where
100% of the light beam is reflected.

0:03:08.520,0:03:09.620
This is called:

0:03:11.780,0:03:14.500
...and you may have heard that when this happens,

0:03:14.500,0:03:18.440
...100% of the INCIDENT beam goes
back as the REFLECTED beam.

0:03:19.100,0:03:20.660
But that's not true.

0:03:20.980,0:03:22.400
These are Maxwell's equations.

0:03:22.400,0:03:23.820
And though they may look innocent,

0:03:23.820,0:03:27.680
...they form the entire foundation
of classical electromagnetism.

0:03:27.760,0:03:29.080
Remember how we said that

0:03:29.080,0:03:31.080
...light is an electromagnetic wave?

0:03:31.260,0:03:34.480
This means that the way light
behaves in different scenarios

0:03:34.480,0:03:37.660
...can be predicted and modeled
by solving Maxwell's equations.

0:03:38.240,0:03:42.720
Now, when we solve these equations
for the case of total internal reflection,

0:03:42.720,0:03:44.920
...we get something very interesting.

0:03:45.720,0:03:46.260
This.

0:03:47.300,0:03:48.980
Isn't that interesting?

0:03:49.440,0:03:53.260
Instead of there being an abrupt drop-off
where the light hits the boundary,

0:03:53.260,0:03:56.380
...there's this very quick exponential drop-off.

0:03:57.080,0:03:58.940
This is shown by this term here:

0:03:59.240,0:04:01.540
I know this looks super complicated, and

0:04:01.540,0:04:02.080
...well,

0:04:02.080,0:04:02.580
...it is.

0:04:02.880,0:04:05.280
So let's just get rid of all that mumbo-jumbo here

0:04:05.280,0:04:06.900
...and just focus on the bit that matters.

0:04:07.540,0:04:09.600
This is a graph of e to the power 'x',

0:04:09.600,0:04:10.740
...which, as you see,

0:04:10.740,0:04:12.440
...models exponential growth.

0:04:12.800,0:04:14.460
But the term in our equation is

0:04:14.460,0:04:16.520
...e to the power of negative x,

0:04:16.520,0:04:17.140
...which is

0:04:17.140,0:04:19.160
...simply the backwards version of this

0:04:19.160,0:04:20.600
...exponential decay.

0:04:21.180,0:04:23.880
So we have this tiny little drop-off wave here.

0:04:24.480,0:04:25.500
This is called an

0:04:26.780,0:04:29.740
...which, in my opinion, is a very suitable name.

0:04:30.160,0:04:30.660
The word

0:04:31.120,0:04:31.660
...means:

0:04:37.120,0:04:40.220
An evanescent wave is pretty much
exactly what it sounds like.

0:04:40.260,0:04:42.160
It decays incredibly quickly,

0:04:42.160,0:04:44.820
...lasting only a few wavelengths before vanishing,

0:04:44.820,0:04:47.360
...so we can't usually see or detect it.

0:04:47.360,0:04:48.020
But,

0:04:48.020,0:04:52.480
...if we place another material sufficiently
close to the boundary of the first,

0:04:52.980,0:04:54.720
...sometimes the evanescent wave

0:04:54.720,0:04:58.800
...doesn't decay completely to zero
before hitting the next material.

0:04:58.800,0:05:01.360
So it can then continue to travel onwards.

0:05:01.980,0:05:02.800
This is called:

0:05:05.440,0:05:08.380
And I recommend looking up
a demo on YouTube after this:

0:05:08.660,0:05:10.300
I would have shown you in this video,

0:05:10.300,0:05:12.120
...but for anyone who has read my Twitter bio,

0:05:12.120,0:05:14.520
...you know that experiments are not my forte.

0:05:15.160,0:05:16.200
I actually did try it,

0:05:16.200,0:05:17.680
...and it just... didn't work.

0:05:17.840,0:05:19.420
Time for a digression.

0:05:19.560,0:05:22.580
Optics was one of my favorite subjects in university,

0:05:22.580,0:05:24.980
...and we did a lot of work on evanescent waves.

0:05:25.100,0:05:28.660
But I never really got a physical intuition for why they're

0:05:28.660,0:05:29.200
...there.

0:05:29.200,0:05:30.880
The only answer I ever found is

0:05:30.880,0:05:32.900
..."because Maxwell's equations say so."

0:05:32.900,0:05:34.300
So, like, when you solve the equations,

0:05:34.300,0:05:36.420
...you end up with this decaying exponential.

0:05:36.420,0:05:38.900
But other than that, I can't really say a physical reason

0:05:38.900,0:05:42.780
...for why a wave can't just abruptly stop
at a boundary and change direction.

0:05:42.940,0:05:44.320
So if you do,

0:05:44.320,0:05:46.120
...please explain it to me in the comments.

0:05:46.460,0:05:47.720
Okay, digression over.

0:05:47.780,0:05:49.420
This wave might be puny,

0:05:49.420,0:05:52.420
...but it's the reason behind why
quantum tunneling is possible.

0:05:52.420,0:05:55.760
Remember that we're trading our
electron as a probability wave.

0:05:56.100,0:05:58.360
...which means that when it gets reflected here,

0:05:58.360,0:06:00.620
...an evanescent wave forms at the boundary.

0:06:00.700,0:06:02.820
If the barrier is thin enough,

0:06:02.820,0:06:03.600
...sometimes

0:06:03.600,0:06:05.980
...some of the wave actually makes it through.

0:06:07.240,0:06:09.300
So if some of the wave makes it through

0:06:09.300,0:06:13.560
...and THIS wave represents the probability
of the location of the electrons,

0:06:13.560,0:06:17.220
...then there's some very small but non-zero probability

0:06:17.220,0:06:18.980
...that our electron is over here,

0:06:19.360,0:06:21.720
...even though this probability is tiny.

0:06:21.720,0:06:26.420
Because there are usually so many quantum
particles involved in any physical process,

0:06:26.420,0:06:29.560
...the effects of quantum tunneling
are large enough to be essential to

0:06:29.560,0:06:31.600
...nuclear fusion in stars,

0:06:31.600,0:06:33.760
...spontaneous mutation in DNA, and

0:06:33.760,0:06:35.640
...scanning tunneling microscopy.

0:06:36.700,0:06:41.440
It may seem startling that we're treating the wave
function exactly like an electromagnetic wave.

0:06:41.680,0:06:44.200
It's hard to imagine something so abstract,

0:06:44.200,0:06:46.940
...like the probabilities of electron locations.

0:06:46.940,0:06:50.840
As a real physical thing that travels
and reflects and tunnels,

0:06:50.840,0:06:54.640
...the truth is scientists still don't know
exactly what the wave function is.

0:06:54.640,0:06:55.800
They don't know whether it's

0:06:55.800,0:07:00.400
...purely a mathematical tool we've created to
help us predict things about quantum objects

0:07:00.400,0:07:02.660
...or whether it's a real, physical wave.

0:07:02.960,0:07:03.920
But what they do know

0:07:03.920,0:07:07.140
...is that it can be modeled pretty much
perfectly by wave mechanics.

0:07:07.380,0:07:11.220
When we solve the Schr√∂dinger wave equation
for the electron inside the barrier,

0:07:11.220,0:07:13.440
...we get this exponential decay,

0:07:13.440,0:07:16.660
...which is exactly what we would
expect of an evanescent wave.

0:07:17.540,0:07:19.600
Speaking of Schr√∂dinger's equation,

0:07:19.600,0:07:21.240
...in my video about that I said:

0:07:21.240,0:07:23.120
If we place an electron in a box,

0:07:23.120,0:07:26.480
...the probability that it could be
found outside the box is zero.

0:07:27.140,0:07:29.020
And a lot of you are confused, because...

0:07:29.020,0:07:30.160
'What about tunneling?'

0:07:30.500,0:07:31.260
Well, the truth is

0:07:31.260,0:07:33.080
...I didn't specify this very well.

0:07:33.320,0:07:35.140
In a lot of university degrees,

0:07:35.140,0:07:39.460
...a particle in a box is the simplest case
we use to analyze Schr√∂dinger's equation.

0:07:39.700,0:07:43.320
But, it's actually a particle in an infinite potential well.

0:07:43.820,0:07:45.400
So, instead of this being a box,

0:07:45.400,0:07:48.700
...look at it as a well with infinitely high and thick walls.

0:07:49.080,0:07:51.360
In tunneling, the barrier needs to be thin enough

0:07:51.360,0:07:52.620
...so that the evanescent wave

0:07:52.620,0:07:56.640
...doesn't have time to completely decay
to zero before reaching the other side.

0:07:56.960,0:07:59.140
Only then can it propagate onwards.

0:07:59.480,0:08:01.600
With infinitely high and thick walls,

0:08:01.600,0:08:03.520
...that's obviously impossible.

0:08:04.140,0:08:05.160
So yeah, my bad.

0:08:05.160,0:08:06.560
Didn't specify infinity.

0:08:06.560,0:08:07.680
In my last video,

0:08:07.680,0:08:10.100
...someone commented asking whether it was futile

0:08:10.100,0:08:13.520
...to try and truly understand quantum
mechanics without doing the math.

0:08:13.520,0:08:15.400
And my immediate reaction was:

Yes.

0:08:16.540,0:08:20.900
While you can learn the catchphrases and
get an overall gist of what's going on,

0:08:20.900,0:08:24.180
...to really get that gut feeling
of understanding the intuition,

0:08:24.180,0:08:27.540
...you need to work through the problems
and see what the equations tell you.

0:08:27.800,0:08:31.560
I didn't really understand the Schr√∂dinger
equation until I solved it myself.

0:08:31.860,0:08:33.800
Brilliant.org is a learning website

0:08:33.800,0:08:36.700
...with an entire course dedicated
to quantum mechanics.

0:08:37.040,0:08:41.420
It starts with the very first experiments
which reveals strange quantum behavior,

0:08:41.420,0:08:43.940
...and takes you all the way to the Schr√∂dinger equation.

0:08:45.200,0:08:47.980
It has this interactive quiz style, which I love,

0:08:47.980,0:08:50.280
...because you can work through
problems at your own pace

0:08:50.280,0:08:52.500
...and check your understanding at every step.

0:08:53.380,0:08:57.660
I actually just worked through these quizzes on the
mathematical foundations of quantum physics,

0:08:57.660,0:08:59.700
...and had a few of my own aha moments,

0:08:59.700,0:09:03.160
...as some questions I'd had since
university were finally answered.

0:09:03.920,0:09:05.780
There're also tons of other courses

0:09:05.780,0:09:08.600
...specialising in math, physics and computer science.

This video is also part of a quantum physics
series I've got going on at the moment,

0:09:39.760,0:09:42.980
...which I've linked for you at the end
of the video and in the description.

0:09:43.120,0:09:44.580
So, until next time.

1
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:07,220
I’m not an urban planner,

2
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:08,730
but I play one on TV.

3
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:10,450
So you might ask,

4
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:12,200
“Why do you run a
YouTube channel about"

5
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,110
"urban planning and
walkable cities then?”

6
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:15,380
And I would say,

7
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:16,620
"What a coincidence!"

8
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:18,610
"That’s the topic of this video.”

9
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,390
I grew up in a car-dependent,

10
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:23,360
car-infested city called London.

11
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:25,450
To avoid confusion on this channel,

12
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:27,960
I usually refer to it as
“Fake London”, or

13
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,930
sometimes something derogatory.

14
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:32,430
By the time I was a teenager,

15
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:34,330
I was pretty bored of Fake London,

16
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:36,050
so I wanted to get out
as quickly as possible

17
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:37,530
and see the rest of the world.

18
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,490
So while I was in university,

19
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:41,060
I took advantage of internships

20
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:43,570
to live in several different
cities in Ontario,

21
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:46,190
as well as in the
San Francisco Bay Area.

22
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:48,090
During this time,

23
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:50,520
I also drove across the
United States 7 times,

24
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,150
and across Canada once.

25
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:55,670
And I stayed in dozens of
cities and towns along the way.

26
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:58,360
Apart from some minor differences,

27
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,940
all of these places
were pretty similar.

28
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:02,720
There’s an overwhelming sameness

29
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,170
between almost all cities
in the U.S. and Canada,

30
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:07,650
primarily due to their
car-centric design.

31
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:09,130
In the end,

32
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:11,380
I decided to live in
downtown Toronto.

33
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:13,580
This was a place that
was interesting to me,

34
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:15,700
but I didn’t really
know why at the time.

35
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:18,580
I just knew I liked it a lot
more than suburbia.

36
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:20,280
Incidentally,

37
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,830
when I lived in downtown Toronto,

38
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:24,050
I was able to easily live car-free,

39
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:25,460
and this allowed me to save

40
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,540
a huge amount of money
when I was young.

41
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:30,320
After the dot-com crash of 2000,

42
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,310
"Pets.com."

43
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:32,810
"Because pets can’t drive!"

44
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:33,908
"Oh, yeah!"

45
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:35,780
"Ooh, this is my kind of party."

46
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:38,530
I was laid off from my
first job out of school,

47
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:41,010
and I was left unemployed
for a very long time.

48
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:42,880
When I finally did find a job,

49
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,070
it was at a significantly lower salary

50
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:46,770
than what I was earning before.

51
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:50,640
There’s simply no way I could have
gotten through that time in my life

52
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,080
if I had to own a car to buy food,

53
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,250
to apply for
unemployment benefits,

54
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:56,790
to go to job interviews,

55
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:57,990
and to go to work.

56
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,660
This is one of the reasons
why I am so hostile

57
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:02,620
towards car-dependent places.

58
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:04,910
Because they are
burdening everyone

59
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:06,670
with thousands of dollars per year

60
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:08,490
for the costs of an automobile,

61
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:10,670
just so that they can work
and feed themselves.

62
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:13,450
This is fundamentally wrong.

63
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:16,210
Nobody should have to own a car,

64
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:18,340
just to participate in society.

65
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:20,750
And designing a city
that way on purpose

66
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,080
is criminal.

67
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:24,990
But what really opened my eyes

68
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:27,160
is when I got a job that
required me to travel.

69
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:28,840
Suddenly I was being sent to

70
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,590
the U.K.,

71
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:30,090
Germany,

72
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:30,730
Taiwan,

73
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:31,570
Japan, and

74
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:33,020
all over the United States.

75
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:34,950
I started realizing that there was a

76
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:37,270
whole world of interesting
cities out there,

77
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:40,830
and they weren’t all the same
car-centric sprawl of the GTA

78
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:42,320
or the Bay Area.

79
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:44,100
During this time,

80
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,770
I travelled excessively,

81
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:48,120
for both personal and business trips.

82
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,870
There was a period of
several years where

83
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:53,380
I wasn't in the same time zone for
more than about 3 weeks at a time.

84
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:57,210
One thing this insane amount
of travel did provide me with,

85
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,690
was the opportunity to see
how other people lived

86
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:00,790
all over the world.

87
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:03,300
I wasn’t going places as a tourist,

88
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,990
I was going to where people
actually lived and worked.

89
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:08,590
I was taking local trains in Tokyo,

90
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:11,080
I was stuck in rush-hour
traffic in Boston,

91
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,370
I was taking the S-Bahn in Berlin,

92
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:16,330
I was taking taxis to remote
factories in Shenzhen.

93
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:19,550
And I was going between these
drastically different cities

94
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:21,220
on a nearly weekly basis.

95
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:24,080
It was amazing to me to see

96
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,160
how different all of these cities were,

97
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,140
and the different ways
that people lived,

98
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:30,690
but at the time I never
really thought about

99
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:32,460
why this was the case.

100
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,930
Like most people,

101
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:35,780
I assumed it was for
cultural reasons, or

102
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:37,810
due to the weather
and local environment,

103
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:40,930
because I was completely
ignorant about urban planning.

104
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:43,250
That all changed

105
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:45,010
during a trip to Houston.

106
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:48,930
I was in the middle of an
around-the-world trip.

107
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:51,880
These are discounted tickets for
travelling to multiple cities,

108
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:55,050
but you need to travel only
in one global direction

109
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:56,150
(always East,)

110
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:57,320
(or always West)

111
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,510
until you’ve flown

112
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:00,130
all the way around the world.

113
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:02,370
For most of my trip, I had taken

114
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:04,800
public transportation in
the cities I had visited,

115
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,350
but I had been to Houston
many times before, and I knew

116
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:08,870
I needed to rent a car.

117
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,030
However, I had met up with some
coworkers for this leg of the journey,

118
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:14,620
so we shared one car
between the three of us.

119
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:18,720
We had a day off on Sunday, and
my coworkers had taken the car.

120
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:20,970
When I was unpacking
in my hotel room,

121
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:23,230
I noticed that my suitcase
was falling apart,

122
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:25,230
so I searched for a
luggage shop nearby.

123
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:28,250
Thankfully, there was
one 800 meters away.

124
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,180
No problem!

125
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:30,530
I decided to walk there.

126
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:32,960
That, was a terrible,

127
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,260
terrible mistake.

128
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:37,140
I exited the hotel to find that

129
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:39,228
it was on a street with no sidewalks.

130
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:40,420
None at all.

131
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:42,830
So I crossed through
the adjacent parking lots.

132
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:45,910
It is disturbingly common to find

133
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:49,150
places without any sidewalks
in American suburbia,

134
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:51,410
but I had grown up
in a car-infested city

135
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:53,040
so I was used to it.

136
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:55,580
As I got out to the main road,

137
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:57,140
there was a sidewalk.

138
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:58,740
I didn’t know it at the time,

139
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:02,130
but this road was what
Strong Towns refers to as a 'stroad':

140
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:04,160
a street that is designed like a road,

141
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,350
and in doing so, is expensive,

142
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:07,380
inefficient,

143
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,780
and dangerous.

144
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:12,150
This walk was pretty uncomfortable.

145
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:13,130
The weather was nice,

146
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:15,520
but there were no trees
to provide any shade.

147
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,640
The landscape was boring and
I was surrounded by asphalt.

148
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:20,700
All of the businesses I passed

149
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,040
were far in the distance,

150
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,810
behind giant parking lots,

151
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:25,470
and the signs were all oversized,

152
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:27,510
and only meant to be
read while driving.

153
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,590
In a place like this,

154
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:31,520
you’re walking next to polluted air

155
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,170
and the constant noise
from high-speed vehicles.

156
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:35,690
And you always need to be alert

157
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:37,950
for any cars going in
and out of driveways,

158
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:40,750
as drivers are only looking
at oncoming traffic,

159
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,710
they are not looking for pedestrians.

160
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:45,440
And in America,
people will blame you

161
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,040
if you’re hit by a car.

162
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:50,330
Stoplights are long and
there are too many of them.

163
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:53,080
And because cars can turn right
on red lights in America,

164
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:56,400
you have to be hyper-aware
when crossing the stroad.

165
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:58,690
This is the kind of
pedestrian experience

166
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:00,580
that people who
never walk anywhere

167
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:01,980
think is acceptable.

168
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,630
But then I got to this spot
and the sidewalk just…

169
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:06,560
ended.

170
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,470
No warning.

171
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:08,560
No alternative.

172
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,100
It was just... gone.

173
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:13,030
But there was a well-trodden
path through the grass,

174
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:14,180
so I followed it to

175
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:15,190
this bridge,

176
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:16,170
where there was...

177
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:17,400
nothing.

178
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:20,800
As I shimmied along the curb

179
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,160
next to the guardrail,

180
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,070
with high-speed cars and
trucks passing by me,

181
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:27,110
I thought about how
ridiculous this was.

182
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:30,190
I was balancing on a
few centimeters of curb

183
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:32,240
while crossing a 28-metre bridge

184
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,110
with 7 lanes of car traffic.

185
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:37,670
There was no consideration given
to anybody who wasn’t in a car,

186
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:39,490
and there was no other alternative

187
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:40,660
for people walking.

188
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:43,750
At that moment, I decided that,

189
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,400
if I lived through this walk,

190
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:48,690
I wanted to live in a place
that was the exact opposite

191
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:50,250
of a place like this.

192
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:52,940
When I made it to the other side,

193
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:54,740
there was also no sidewalk, of course.

194
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,450
And I crossed through
some more parking lots

195
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:57,910
to get to the luggage shop.

196
00:06:58,750 --> 00:06:59,850
Needless to say,

197
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:01,610
I took a cab back to the hotel.

198
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:02,560
Yeah.

199
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,880
I took a taxi,

200
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,170
to go 800 meters.

201
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:08,690
In the United States,

202
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:12,280
over 45% of car trips
are 3 miles or less.

203
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,170
Less than 5 kilometers.

204
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:15,590
That’s insane.

205
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,750
Europeans assume
Americans drive everywhere

206
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,400
because "they’re fat and lazy",

207
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,470
but it’s not.

208
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:23,130
It’s because these trips simply

209
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:25,020
can’t be done any other way.

210
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:27,980
When I got back to my hotel,

211
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,630
I started reading about
how cities were designed.

212
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:32,240
I learned about car-dependency

213
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,250
and I learned about walkability.

214
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:36,930
And I learned about how these
places have changed over time,

215
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:39,930
and how some places have
designed their cities for humans,

216
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:41,980
not just for motor vehicles.

217
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:45,050
One of the things
that really upset me

218
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:47,300
is that the desolate
asphalt-covered cities

219
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,220
I had visited in the U.S. and Canada

220
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,920
weren’t always this way.

221
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:53,280
I was told that these
cities were like this

222
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,588
because they were
“designed for the car".

223
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:56,948
That’s not true.

224
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:58,830
They weren't designed for the car,

225
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:00,740
they were bulldozed for the car.

226
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:04,250
Look at these pictures of my
hometown of Fake London.

227
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:05,380
This city

228
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:06,700
is beautiful.

229
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,390
Now it looks like this.

230
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:14,380
This is a picture of
Houston in the 1970s.

231
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:16,060
No, it wasn’t bombed.

232
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,840
They did this to themselves.

233
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:21,080
This used to be a
compact, walkable city

234
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:24,110
that was just as good as
those in Europe or Asia.

235
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:25,560
And they destroyed it.

236
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,400
When you see a place like this,

237
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,250
you think the developers must
have got away with something,

238
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:33,340
but literally everything you see,

239
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:37,040
right down to the colour of the paint
of the lines in the parking lot,

240
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,830
are defined in some
book of regulations.

241
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:42,500
And those regulations are
overwhelmingly designed

242
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,750
to make places that
are only accessible

243
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:45,880
by car.

244
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,457
This is entirely by design,

245
00:08:48,459 --> 00:08:50,610
and it’s entirely by choice.

246
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:52,170
It didn’t need to be this way,

247
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:54,310
and it doesn’t need to stay this way.

248
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:57,150
And THAT is why I became interested

249
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,450
in urban planning.

250
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,070
My walk in Houston was
not the first or the last

251
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:05,860
terrible experience I would have
walking in an American city,

252
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:07,520
but it was the most memorable.

253
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:10,220
And I have absolutely zero
patience for apologists

254
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:13,170
for this kind of car-centric,
anti-human design.

255
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:14,930
I clearly wasn’t

256
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:17,240
the only person who
had ever walked here,

257
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,270
as proven by the path in the grass.

258
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:22,460
You can see people walking
here on Google Street View.

259
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,120
In a place like this,

260
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,820
if you’re too poor to drive a car,

261
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,680
then you’re literally forgotten about.

262
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,270
And this situation hasn’t
changed at all in the last decade,

263
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:33,730
which is why I was able
to get this video of it.

264
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,510
There’s no excuse for this.

265
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:39,940
If you have enough room
for 7 lanes of car traffic,

266
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:42,180
then you have enough
room for a sidewalk,

267
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,450
or a bicycle path.

268
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,940
This is what a 28-metre
bridge looks like

269
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:47,140
in Amsterdam.

270
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:48,690
It has a sidewalk,

271
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:50,020
and a two-way bicycle path

272
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,810
on both sides of the road.

273
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:53,320
And yeah,

274
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,640
this area in Houston
is very suburban;

275
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,320
almost 30 kilometers
from the city center,

276
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,920
but that’s no excuse.

277
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:02,840
The area is lined with
businesses and shops,

278
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,460
many of which are staffed
by minimum-wage workers.

279
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:06,940
In America,

280
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,920
housing prices are talked about a lot,

281
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,440
but the most important metric

282
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,600
is housing PLUS
transportation costs.

283
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:16,130
How are these employees
supposed to get to work?

284
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:17,770
Do they all need to drive?

285
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:19,520
Can they even afford to do that?

286
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:23,340
Here’s what an industrial park
in the middle of nowhere

287
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:24,820
looks like in the Netherlands.

288
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:27,040
The street is only 2 lanes wide,

289
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,420
and there’s a beautiful
two-way cycling path

290
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,920
that can be used for people
walking and cycling.

291
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,320
North Americans balk at designing

292
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,290
pedestrian and
cycling infrastructure

293
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:38,390
anywhere but in busy downtowns.

294
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:39,550
But here,

295
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:42,220
employees of the nearby
factories and warehouses

296
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,900
can use these safe paths

297
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,470
to get to and from work,

298
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:48,100
and for other trips like
going for lunch, too.

299
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,210
There is always a long list
of excuses people make

300
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:55,210
as to why nobody walks or
cycles in North America.

301
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:56,450
But that’s what they are:

302
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:57,520
excuses.

303
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,160
The real reason is that
it’s not enjoyable,

304
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,760
comfortable, or safe

305
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,030
to walk or cycle

306
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:04,470
in a place like this.

307
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:07,470
Yeah, the weather
is bad sometimes,

308
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:09,000
or there might be hills,

309
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,220
but don’t you think that this guy
would appreciate a sidewalk?

310
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:17,280
Houston is one of the worst
examples of urban sprawl.

311
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:18,780
For my Dutch viewers,

312
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:20,990
if Amsterdam were as
sprawling as Houston,

313
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:22,080
then a circle including

314
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:22,880
Alkmaar,

315
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,690
Leiden,

316
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:24,310
Utrecht,

317
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:25,330
and Lelystad

318
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:28,770
would all be connected by
continuous car-dependent sprawl.

319
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,180
There is a right way

320
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:33,540
and a wrong way to design a city,

321
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:36,200
and this is decidedly the wrong way,

322
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,080
for so many reasons.

323
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:38,980
And by the way,

324
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,970
the barbeque joints
in Houston are good,

325
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:43,020
but the best brisket
I ever had in my life

326
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:44,400
was at Mighty Quinn’s.

327
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,080
And you know where
that restaurant is?

328
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,020
New York City.

329
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:50,260
"New York City!?"

330
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:51,620
"Get a rope."

331
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:52,800
But the sad part is,

332
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,920
Houston is not even the
worst city in the U.S.,

333
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,190
and the city is actually doing
more to change things

334
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:58,930
than many other U.S. cities.

335
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:00,880
For example,

336
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,080
Houston recently deployed a
completely new bus network

337
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,460
literally overnight,

338
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:08,110
and it has led to
significantly higher ridership.

339
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:11,570
Streetfilms made an excellent
video about these changes.

340
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:12,800
They’re really great.

341
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,650
Bravo to Houston Metro
for doing this.

342
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:19,670
Houston has been installing
several bicycle lanes as well.

343
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:22,610
And the city has removed
minimum parking requirements

344
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:24,310
for 2 downtown neighbourhoods,

345
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:26,220
in an attempt to
build a more walkable

346
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:27,930
mixed-use downtown.

347
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:30,530
Speaking of mixed-use,

348
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:33,988
it is a common myth that
Houston does not have zoning.

349
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:37,900
It’s true that the city does not
have a thing called 'zoning',

350
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,660
but they have lots
of other restrictions,

351
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:41,900
such as minimum
parking requirements,

352
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,320
minimum lot sizes,

353
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:47,310
and other regulations that cities would
normally put into their zoning codes.

354
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,830
And they also have city-enforced

355
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:51,340
deed restrictions that limit

356
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:54,170
what you can build on
certain parcels of land,

357
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:56,280
that allows, for example,

358
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:59,430
only single-family homes to be
built in many neighbourhoods.

359
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,770
In short,

360
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:03,360
Houston has all of the worst
parts of a zoning ordinance,

361
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,090
they just don’t call it 'zoning'.

362
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:08,870
City Beautiful has a
great video about this

363
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:10,730
if you’re interested in learning more.

364
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,790
But despite all the work
that is being done,

365
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:15,410
Houston has a very, very,

366
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:17,170
very long way to go.

367
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:21,030
The city recently completed
a multimillion-dollar project

368
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:24,320
that is called a “protected
intersection for pedestrians".

369
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:27,350
Does this look
pedestrian-friendly to you?

370
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,590
It is the intersection of
two 6-lane stroads,

371
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:33,570
and it literally has high-speed
slip lanes for drivers

372
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:36,430
so that they can bypass the
traffic light when turning right.

373
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:40,610
Slip lanes are insanely
dangerous for people walking.

374
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:42,590
It’s absolutely ridiculous

375
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:45,250
that engineers would
purposefully design slip lanes

376
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:48,220
in a place that’s supposedly
meant for pedestrians,

377
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:50,860
and being billed as
"pedestrian-friendly".

378
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:53,350
I mean, I guess it’s better

379
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:56,840
than walking through the grass and
across a death-bridge with no sidewalk?

380
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,090
But come on!

381
00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:00,840
This is what counts as
"pedestrian infrastructure"?

382
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:02,160
And of course,

383
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,440
Houston is also home
to the Katy freeway,

384
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,760
the widest freeway
in the United States.

385
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,580
In 2011,

386
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:10,820
2.2 billion dollars was spent

387
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:13,320
widening the highway
to over 20 lanes,

388
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,450
and as a result,

389
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:16,980
travel times out of
downtown have increased

390
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:18,810
by up to 30%.

391
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:22,040
This is a massive sum of money

392
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,270
that could have been better
spent on public transit

393
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:26,040
or other alternatives to driving

394
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,150
that are proven to reduce car traffic,

395
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:31,100
but instead it was used as an
expensive demonstration

396
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,490
of induced demand.

397
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:35,730
And no lessons have
been learned here.

398
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:37,460
The city and state are
planning an additional

399
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:39,720
7 billion dollars on
highway expansion.

400
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:41,180
This project will demolish

401
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,680
4 religious buildings,

402
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:43,840
2 schools,

403
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:48,160
168 homes,

404
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,510
1,067 multifamily units,

405
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:54,130
and 331 businesses

406
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:57,200
that employ almost 25,000 people.

407
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,460
It is literally

408
00:14:58,460 --> 00:14:59,560
never-ending.

409
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:01,650
It’s often said that

410
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:03,490
the truth about a city’s aspirations

411
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:04,930
isn’t found in its vision,

412
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:06,700
it’s found in its budget.

413
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:09,680
So despite the millions spent
on pedestrian improvements

414
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,730
that somehow also include
faster turning lanes for drivers,

415
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:15,670
Houston is spending billions
on car infrastructure,

416
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:18,420
and is fully addicted
to car-dependency.

417
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:22,190
I just... don’t know how
you undo the damage

418
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:24,580
caused by a place
designed like this.

419
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:27,660
How does this ever
become sustainable?

420
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,050
Financially or environmentally?

421
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:32,470
And to me, the most sad part

422
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:35,810
is that people who have grown up
only knowing car dependence

423
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:37,590
don’t see a problem with this.

424
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:39,480
To them, restricting cars is

425
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,490
literally taking away their freedom,

426
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:44,220
because they have become
so addicted to car-dependency

427
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:46,360
that they are incapable
of understanding

428
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,870
that it is possible to
design places where,

429
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:51,020
not only do you not need to drive,

430
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:52,760
you won’t even want to drive,

431
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,640
and that lifestyle can be better

432
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,720
in almost every way.

433
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:00,740
My travels gave me
the opportunity to visit

434
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:02,790
every major city in
the United States,

435
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:04,360
most of them multiple times.

436
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,450
And as a result,

437
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:07,430
I have absolutely no desire

438
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:09,510
to go back to any of them.

439
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:12,380
But those experiences shaped
the way I think about cities,

440
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:14,530
and they're what ultimately
resulted in our family

441
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:15,990
moving to the Netherlands,

442
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:18,380
the country that has the
best cities in the world.

443
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:19,850
And hey,

444
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:21,520
if Houston weren’t so terrible,

445
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,730
we never would have this
YouTube channel, so...

446
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:25,060
thanks, Houston!

447
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:26,200
I owe you one.

448
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,490

1
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:04,910
JASON (voiceover): I grew up in
a car-infested city called London.

2
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:06,800
London, Ontario, Canada.

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,750
But we don’t want to raise our kids

4
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:10,428
in an environment like this,

5
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:12,460
and we moved to Amsterdam instead.

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,400
So why is that?

7
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,680
One thing you immediately notice

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,620
when coming to the Netherlands is that

9
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:23,330
there are a lot of children around.

10
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:25,370
You’ll routinely see even

11
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:27,110
young children cycling to school,

12
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:28,940
playing with their friends, and just

13
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:30,280
hanging out in the city.

14
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:32,920
The Dutch are famous for having

15
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,870
the happiest kids in the world, and

16
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:37,120
a big part of that is
the fact that they can

17
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,180
literally have chocolate sprinkles

18
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:40,240
for breakfast.

19
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:42,280
But the other big factor

20
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,940
is the level of independence
that children have here.

21
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:48,210
I got used to seeing children everywhere,

22
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:49,980
so it was amazing to see the difference

23
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,710
the first time I returned to
my hometown in Canada.

24
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,060
I drove around several
residential neighborhoods, and

25
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:59,570
while I occasionally saw some
kids in the park with their parents,

26
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:02,190
I never saw any children
out on their own, and...

27
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:04,000
that’s really sad.

28
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:07,920
I’ve talked to some parents
from suburban Canada

29
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,920
about why they don’t let their
children out on their own,

30
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,930
and they usually say,
"Because it’s too dangerous".

31
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:14,520
One person even said,

32
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,610
"Somebody could come
along with a white van,"

33
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:18,960
"scoop them up, and
nobody would even notice.”

34
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:21,440
Now, that’s insane,

35
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,710
because Canada is one of the
safest countries in the world,

36
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:27,110
and abductions by strangers
are exceedingly unlikely,

37
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:27,750
so...

38
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:29,280
why do people think this?

39
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:33,100
Well, there are various reasons
for this cultural change,

40
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:35,270
including an increase in
fearmongering media,

41
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:36,920
but this is an urban planning channel,

42
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:40,590
so we’re going to talk about the reasons
linked to city design. because...

43
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:41,940
there are a lot of them.

44
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:44,290
In her famous book

45
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:46,870
<i>The Death and Life of
Great American Cities</i>,

46
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:49,480
Jane Jacobs refers to an effect she calls

47
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,760
“eyes on the street".

48
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,010
Essentially, it means
that people feel safer

49
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:56,890
to be in places with many
other people, like here,

50
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:58,780
in this suburb of Amsterdam.

51
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,210
By comparison,

52
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:03,730
North American-style
car-dependent suburbia

53
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:06,350
is desolate for people outside of a car.

54
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:08,700
It’s depressing to walk there,

55
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:10,780
and I know, because I’ve done it a lot,

56
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:12,990
in the process of filming these videos.

57
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:16,040
I’m almost always the
only one out walking,

58
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:19,010
and I definitely get the feeling that
if something happened to me,

59
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:20,900
hundreds of people would drive by

60
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,360
without even noticing.

61
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,000
So it shouldn’t be too surprising

62
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,010
that some parents are uncomfortable
having their children walk

63
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:29,760
in an environment like this.

64
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:32,760
Now, there’s another

65
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,170
“safety” reason that’s
a bit more rational:

66
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,110
Canadian and American cities

67
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:39,480
are really dangerous for pedestrians.

68
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,560
While overall traffic fatalities
in developed nations

69
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,710
have generally fallen
steadily since the 1970s,

70
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:47,160
in the US and Canada,

71
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,720
a big part of this was achieved

72
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,460
by putting almost everyone

73
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:51,880
inside of a car.

74
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,020
But while people inside
of cars may be safer,

75
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:58,160
pedestrian deaths have increased
significantly in the past few decades,

76
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,100
due to:

77
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:01,410
an increase in car traffic,

78
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:03,680
larger trucks and SUVs,

79
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,510
distracted driving,

80
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:07,280
and higher vehicle speeds.

81
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:09,190
Ultimately,

82
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:11,830
these unsafe roads
ead to a vicious circle:

83
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:14,140
parents are more likely to
drive their children everywhere

84
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:16,600
because it’s not safe due to all the cars,

85
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,150
but in doing so, they’re adding
one more car to the problem,

86
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:21,070
and making it even less safe.

87
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,290
I’d like to point out that
this is a unique problem

88
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:26,340
caused only by cars.

89
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:27,400
I mean,

90
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,450
nobody ever kept their kids
from walking to school

91
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:31,990
just because too many
people took the tram.

92
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:34,990
But also, it’s impractical for children

93
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:37,530
to go anywhere on their
own in a place like this.

94
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:40,540
Suburbia is car-dependent.

95
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:43,030
That means it’s almost
impossible to get anywhere

96
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,260
without a car.

97
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:47,950
So even if you wanted your
child to walk somewhere,

98
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:49,850
they simply... can’t.

99
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:51,490
It’s either too far,

100
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:54,370
or it's not feasible, because
of a lack of sidewalks.

101
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:57,730
When I have discussions with

102
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:00,240
people from my suburban
hellscape of a hometown,

103
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,760
they usually agree that the city is quiet

104
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,310
and soul-crushingly boring,

105
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:06,460
but they will inevitably say,

106
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:09,160
“But it’s a good place to raise children.”

107
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,410
I completely disagree.

108
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:15,180
Suburbia might be a good
place to shelter toddlers,

109
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:18,670
but as soon as a child is
more than about 6 years old,

110
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:21,790
being trapped in a McMansion
on the edge of town

111
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:24,130
seriously inhibits their
growth and independence.

112
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,030
They might be able to
walk to a friend’s house,

113
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:29,850
if they’re lucky enough to live
somewhere with a sidewalk.

114
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:31,940
But they’re unlikely to be
able to walk to school,

115
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:34,180
or anywhere else for that matter.

116
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:36,580
In the Netherlands,

117
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:39,470
60% of children walk or cycle to school,

118
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:42,130
compared to 28% in Canada,

119
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:44,750
mostly those kids who
live in the few remaining

120
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:48,400
walkable pre-war neighborhoods
that would be illegal to build today

121
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,990
due to modern zoning.

122
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:52,210
But when I was a kid,

123
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:55,400
that number was 58% in Canada,

124
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,540
almost identical to the Netherlands today.

125
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:01,080
Look at these Canadian kids

126
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:04,120
walking to their rural
school in the 1920s,

127
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,060
through the snow,

128
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:06,560
uphill both ways.

129
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,250
Yeah,

130
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,270
that never happens anymore.

131
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:14,570
This is the bicycle parking lot of a
typical middle school in Amsterdam.

132
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:18,750
And this is the bicycle parking lot
of an elementary school.

133
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:20,530
It is obvious here that

134
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:23,720
the majority of children
arrive on their own bicycles.

135
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:28,010
I’m constantly hearing excuses
from North Americans

136
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:30,940
as to why kids can walk or cycle
to school in the Netherlands

137
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:32,410
but not in Canada,

138
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:35,670
and it’s usually some nonsense
about the weather or the hills.

139
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,900
Do either of those things
explain the massive drop in

140
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:41,350
the number of kids walking
to school in Canada?

141
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:44,770
Did Canada’s weather get
worse in the past 40 years?

142
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,438
Did the hills get higher?

143
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,860
No, of course not.

144
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,380
But we did stop building
family-friendly housing

145
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:53,580
anywhere that wasn’t car-dependent.

146
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,510
Meanwhile, here in the Netherlands,

147
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:59,750
it’s not just kids in cities
who cycle to school, it's...

148
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:00,840
everywhere.

149
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:03,700
BicycleDutch has several videos showing

150
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:06,430
dozens of children cycling
long distances to school

151
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:08,460
in suburbs, towns, and villages.

152
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,250
And it’s more than just school, too.

153
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,810
Kids have lots of sports
and other activities,

154
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:15,030
so in the Netherlands,

155
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:17,630
it’s very common to see
children walking or cycling

156
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:18,710
while dressed in

157
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:19,840
football gear,

158
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,490
(not that kind of football)

159
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:23,190
or hockey gear,

160
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:25,060
(not that kind of hockey)

161
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:28,150
because they travel to all these
activities by themselves.

162
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,990
In the US and Canada,

163
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:33,450
you have the stereotype of the suburban

164
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:34,600
'soccer mom',

165
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,470
the mother who spends all her time
shuttling her kids around

166
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:40,360
from school to activities
to playdates and back.

167
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:41,650
Because,

168
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:43,320
until a kid is about 16 years old

169
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,550
and has their own driver’s license,

170
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:48,160
they need to be driven around
everywhere by their parents,

171
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:48,820
and...

172
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,450
this is considered

173
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:51,480
“normal”.

174
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:53,940
Is it any surprise that

175
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:56,850
kids in the U.S. and Canada
don’t get enough exercise?

176
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,650
But I can’t blame them
for wanting to stay inside

177
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:01,150
playing video games all day,

178
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:01,820
when

179
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,770
outside looks like this.

180
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:08,950
These problems originate
in car-dependent suburbs,

181
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:10,030
but unfortunately,

182
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:13,250
decades of suburbanization
have changed the overall culture,

183
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:14,810
where now many Canadians

184
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:17,920
don’t believe it’s safe for any
children to be out on their own.

185
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:20,750
So even if you could afford to live in

186
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:23,420
one of the very few remaining
walkable neighbourhoods,

187
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:26,910
you still can’t give your children
the independence they deserve.

188
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:29,820
For example, here in Amsterdam,

189
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:32,570
we started allowing our children
to go to the park without us

190
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:34,930
when they were 9 and 6 years old.

191
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:38,140
This is totally normal and
accepted in the Netherlands.

192
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,420
If we let our children do this in Canada,

193
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:42,650
we would literally have
someone call the police.

194
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:43,660
Or worse.

195
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:46,160
Now, you might think I’m exaggerating,

196
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,750
but there are stories about this happening

197
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,730
all over the U.S. and Canada,

198
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:51,390
and the one that angered me the most,

199
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:53,330
was the story of Adrian Crook.

200
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:56,870
Adrian is a father of 5 children,

201
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:59,150
and lives in downtown Vancouver, Canada.

202
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,590
He has always been a vocal advocate of
allowing kids to have their independence,

203
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:05,020
and has written about how
walkable urban city design

204
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:07,780
makes this easier and more practical.

205
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:09,770
As part of this effort,

206
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:12,610
Adrian and his kids would ride
the bus to school every day.

207
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:14,800
He did this with them for two years,

208
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,230
but in 2017,

209
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:18,350
he started letting them
do it on their own.

210
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,550
A short time later, he was
anonymously reported

211
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:24,000
to the Ministry of Children
and Family Development.

212
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:27,160
The whole story is available on
his blog, that I’ll link to below,

213
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,490
but in the end,

214
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:31,070
the Ministry decided that
children under the age of 10

215
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:32,700
could not be unsupervised

216
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,200
in or outside of the home,

217
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,020
for any amount of time,

218
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:39,260
and if Adrian let any of his
children out unsupervised again,

219
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,660
even to go to the store across the street,

220
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:44,070
his children would be taken away from him.

221
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:48,170
Adrian literally had to
spend 3 years of his life

222
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:50,640
suing the Ministry of Children
and Family Development

223
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,240
just to allow his children

224
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,760
to have some independence.

225
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:56,120
And if you think that’s insane,

226
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,950
in Ontario, the province where I’m from,

227
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:02,260
children legally can not be
on their own until they're 16,

228
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:03,350
unless, quote,

229
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:04,800
“adequate supervision”

230
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,080
is provided.

231
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,140
When I was a kid,

232
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:10,100
'adequate supervision' was, say,

233
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,960
having the phone number of a neighbor.

234
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:13,640
But the problem is,

235
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:17,070
what constitutes “adequate supervision”
is becoming increasingly strict,

236
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:19,180
and arbitrarily applied.

237
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:22,950
This article has examples
from all over Canada,

238
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:25,930
where child welfare investigations
were started because,

239
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:26,950
for example,

240
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:30,080
a 9-year-old walked to school on her own,

241
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,190
or because a mother allowed
her children to play in

242
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:36,070
the fenced backyard of their own house,

243
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:38,320
while she was watching them from inside.

244
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:40,370
Now, you might say that these

245
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:43,590
visits from police or social
workers are just overreactions,

246
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:45,930
and it’s better to be safe than sorry.

247
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,710
But these social workers have the power to

248
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:51,220
literally take your
children away from you.

249
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:54,120
You’re crazy if you don’t think
this has a chilling effect

250
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:57,730
that ultimately limits the independence
of children in North America.

251
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:01,090
Personally, I have absolutely no interest

252
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:02,570
in finding out the hard way what the

253
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:06,190
currently-accepted definition of
“adequate supervision” may be,

254
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:08,610
when it comes to keeping
custody of my children.

255
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:13,130
Unfortunately, the solutions to
these problems are not easy,

256
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:14,740
because they involve changing

257
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,100
not just cultural issues,

258
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:19,980
but also the fundamental design of
North American cities and suburbs.

259
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:23,050
Traditional mixed-use
walkable neighbourhoods

260
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:25,200
have a multitude of benefits,

261
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,570
but walkability is nearly
impossible to retrofit

262
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:30,670
on top of car-dependent suburbia.

263
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,630
And the last few remaining walkable
places in the US and Canada

264
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:36,400
are in such high demand,

265
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:39,180
that they’re completely
unaffordable to most people.

266
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:40,960
Of course,

267
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:44,370
we’re also not building any more
walkable places like this in Canada,

268
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:46,110
because they’re illegal to build,

269
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:48,370
due to zoning and car-centric regulations,

270
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:50,350
like minimum parking requirements.

271
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:53,827
So what was built a
hundred years ago is it.

272
00:10:53,829 --> 00:10:55,047
We’re not getting any more.

273
00:10:55,049 --> 00:10:56,640
And if you can’t afford it,

274
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,450
too bad.

275
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:01,470
There’s this insane myth in North America

276
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:03,980
that when you have kids, you need a car,

277
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:05,800
and you need to live in suburbia,

278
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,110
when the exact opposite is true.

279
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:11,390
What children really need is fewer cars,

280
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:13,670
because cars are dangerous,

281
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:14,870
especially for children.

282
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:16,790
Plus, news flash:

283
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:18,430
Kids can’t drive!

284
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:21,830
But they can walk or cycle, though

285
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:23,220
only if it’s safe.

286
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:26,420
Here in the Netherlands,

287
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:28,680
almost all new neighborhoods are walkable,

288
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,620
and some of them are even car-free.

289
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:32,970
Unsurprisingly, you see kids

290
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:35,770
travelling on their own and
playing together in the streets.

291
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:38,420
So a few years ago,

292
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:40,420
my wife and I had to make a decision.

293
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,860
What kind of a life did
we want for us and,

294
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:45,160
more importantly, for our children?

295
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:46,660
The solution

296
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:47,920
seemed pretty clear:

297
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:51,700
we moved to the country with
the happiest kids in the world.

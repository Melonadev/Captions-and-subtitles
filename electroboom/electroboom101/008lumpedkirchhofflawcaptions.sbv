Hi.

0:00:00.580,0:00:02.100
Welcome to another episode of:

0:00:03.540,0:00:05.740
...where I will teach YOU electronics

0:00:05.740,0:00:07.200
...by over-editing my video

0:00:07.200,0:00:08.040
...to make it look

0:00:10.020,0:00:12.220
I have covered a bunch of things so far.

0:00:12.220,0:00:13.300
Watch them if you haven't,

0:00:13.300,0:00:15.340
...because slowly we are getting to a point

0:00:15.340,0:00:16.840
...where we can design stuff

0:00:16.840,0:00:17.800
ｔｏｇｅｔｈｅｒ！

0:00:17.800,0:00:19.080
I have talked about

0:00:19.080,0:00:20.160
...resistors,

0:00:20.160,0:00:20.820
...capacitors

0:00:20.820,0:00:22.040
...and inductors.

0:00:22.280,0:00:25.320
Resistance and capacitance deal with electric fields,

0:00:25.320,0:00:28.080
...while inductance deals with magnetic fields.

0:00:28.460,0:00:31.480
So one can model the entire electromagnetism

0:00:31.480,0:00:32.760
...using these properties.

0:00:32.780,0:00:34.040
Well, maybe not all of it,

0:00:34.040,0:00:34.960
...but close enough.

0:00:34.960,0:00:37.180
Resistors resist against the current flow

0:00:37.180,0:00:38.580
...and convert the energy

0:00:38.580,0:00:39.380
...into heat-

[REDACTED]

0:00:40.700,0:00:41.800
A capacitor

0:00:41.800,0:00:45.800
...stores energy in form of electric
fields between electric charges,

0:00:45.800,0:00:47.380
...and can later release them

0:00:47.380,0:00:49.060
...when a load is connected between-

Damn it!

0:00:53.240,0:00:54.960
...and if you don't know how to use them

0:00:54.960,0:00:56.780
...it will convert the energy into heat.

0:00:56.780,0:00:57.980
Inductors

0:00:57.980,0:01:00.780
...store energy in the form of magnetic fields.

0:01:01.060,0:01:01.920
Oh [REDACTED]!

0:01:02.100,0:01:02.600
And yeah,

0:01:02.600,0:01:04.980
...I guess every wire has a resistance too.

0:01:04.980,0:01:06.960
Any other components in electronics,

0:01:06.960,0:01:08.460

0:01:14.120,0:01:15.260
...one way or another.

0:01:15.260,0:01:16.940
Now, let's try to learn

0:01:16.940,0:01:18.360
...how to analyze a circuit

0:01:18.360,0:01:19.900
...and for that you must understand

0:01:39.860,0:01:42.460

But,

0:02:12.860,0:02:14.200
...what is a lumped model?

0:02:15.040,0:02:16.620
Have you ever been so sad,

0:02:16.620,0:02:18.320
...that you felt like a lump

0:02:18.320,0:02:20.280
...was appearing in your throat?

0:02:21.100,0:02:23.000
You could scream and cry.

0:02:23.000,0:02:24.460
But because you're a caveman

0:02:24.460,0:02:26.200
...you bottle up your feelings

0:02:26.200,0:02:28.160
...and take them to your grave with you,

0:02:28.160,0:02:29.420
...where they belong,

0:02:29.420,0:02:30.480
...and act like-

0:02:30.680,0:02:31.720
Everything's fine!

0:02:31.720,0:02:33.120
Lumped model is the same.

0:02:33.120,0:02:35.020
Basically, in a lumped element model,

0:02:35.020,0:02:36.720
...all sort of radiations from:

0:02:37.900,0:02:38.400
...or even

0:02:38.920,0:02:40.740
...are bottled up inside a component

0:02:40.740,0:02:42.140
...and don't leak out.

0:02:42.140,0:02:43.720
Only the voltage and current

0:02:43.720,0:02:45.360
...are affected by the component.

0:02:45.360,0:02:46.520
This makes life very easy,

0:02:46.520,0:02:49.060
...because if components don't
bottle up their [REDACTED]

0:02:49.060,0:02:50.720
...and radiate stuff around,

0:02:50.720,0:02:53.240
...they start affecting the surrounding circuits

0:02:53.240,0:02:55.360
...and this 'crosstalk' between the components

0:02:55.360,0:02:58.280
...makes it very hard to analyze circuit behavior.

0:02:58.280,0:02:58.840
For example,

0:02:58.840,0:03:00.660
...if a hot resistor gets close

0:03:00.660,0:03:02.540
...and warms up a transistor,

0:03:02.540,0:03:05.360
...the transistor parameters are significantly affected.

0:03:05.360,0:03:07.900
If an inductor radiates magnetic fields,

0:03:07.900,0:03:10.260
...it will induce unwanted current

0:03:10.260,0:03:12.020
...in the neighboring circuit loops.

0:03:12.200,0:03:14.600
If electric fields leak from a capacitor,

0:03:14.600,0:03:16.820
...they can create unwanted voltage

0:03:16.820,0:03:18.540
...on neighboring conductors.

0:03:18.540,0:03:19.920
And all these leakages

0:03:19.920,0:03:22.600
...make it very hard to understand the circuit behavior!

0:03:26.280,0:03:27.300
But the fact is

0:03:27.540,0:03:29.540
...no component is truly lumped.

0:03:29.940,0:03:30.920
All components

0:03:30.920,0:03:33.200
...always radiate [REDACTED] and affect each other.

0:03:33.980,0:03:36.620

But, hey, We are not here to deal with black magic.

0:03:36.620,0:03:38.500
[ᴄᴏʀᴘᴏʀᴀᴛᴇ 'ʜᴀᴘᴘʏ' ᴍᴜꜱɪᴄ]
So nothing will affect nothing!

0:03:38.500,0:03:39.320
At least for now,

0:03:39.320,0:03:40.880
...until we grow a little bit more.

0:03:40.880,0:03:41.500
And with that,

0:03:41.500,0:03:44.900
...let's jump into two of the most
important laws of electronics!

0:03:44.900,0:03:46.080
...first described by:

0:03:47.480,0:03:48.860
[attempts to pronouce 'Kirchhoff']

0:03:48.860,0:03:49.360
Yeah.

0:03:49.500,0:03:50.520
Karl Gustav-

0:03:51.080,0:03:51.280
ʜᴇʜ

0:03:51.280,0:03:52.000
...called:

0:03:53.580,0:03:54.280
One is:

0:03:56.460,0:03:57.760
...and the other one is:

0:04:00.500,0:04:02.280
You need to understand these well,

0:04:02.280,0:04:05.040
...because soon we will be designing circuits together.

0:04:05.040,0:04:06.920
These laws are easiest to understand,

0:04:06.920,0:04:09.380
...and work best when the components are lumped

0:04:09.380,0:04:11.400
...and nothing radiates on nothing else.

0:04:11.400,0:04:12.980
So, let's start from there.

0:04:12.980,0:04:15.020
Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL) states that

0:04:15.020,0:04:17.300
...in any closed loop of a circuit,

0:04:17.300,0:04:21.160
...the sum of all voltages (V) across
components in that loop

0:04:21.160,0:04:22.040
...is zero.

0:04:22.040,0:04:24.820
And that's based on the law of conservation of energy.

0:04:25.100,0:04:27.200
A lumped model makes it easy.

0:04:27.200,0:04:28.460
I'll talk about that later.

0:04:28.460,0:04:29.960
According to my definition,

0:04:29.960,0:04:32.100
KVL is 𝗻𝗼𝘁 this!

0:04:32.100,0:04:33.320
Let's expand it a bit.

0:04:33.320,0:04:35.280
Imagine we have a circuit like this,

0:04:35.280,0:04:38.380
...and I don't know the polarity of
voltages across components.

0:04:38.380,0:04:40.000
But I want to know their relations.

0:04:40.300,0:04:40.960
First,

0:04:40.960,0:04:42.180
...I assign

0:04:42.780,0:04:43.620
...polarities

0:04:43.620,0:04:44.860
...across the components

0:04:44.860,0:04:46.200
...any way I like.

0:04:46.980,0:04:49.320
One important thing you should remember is that,

0:04:49.320,0:04:51.860
...it doesn't matter how you assign your polarities,

0:04:51.860,0:04:53.640
...as long as you stick with them

0:04:53.640,0:04:54.360
𝙁𝙊𝙍𝙀𝙑𝙀𝙍!

0:04:54.600,0:04:56.140
You can't change them halfway,

0:04:56.140,0:04:57.680
...or you'll have to start over.

0:04:57.680,0:04:58.500
For example,

0:04:58.500,0:05:00.700
...if you assign your voltage like this,

0:05:00.700,0:05:03.440
...but the actual voltage is positive this way,

0:05:03.440,0:05:04.580
...it doesn't matter!

0:05:04.580,0:05:07.060
The value you get for your voltage assignment

0:05:07.060,0:05:08.020
...will be negative,

0:05:08.020,0:05:09.340
...which is absolutely fine!

0:05:09.340,0:05:10.520
So don't worry about it.

0:05:10.520,0:05:12.180
Now, let's play a game of

0:05:12.180,0:05:14.260
'How many loops you see in this circuit.'

0:05:14.960,0:05:15.820
4, you say?

0:05:16.020,0:05:16.740
Ｗ Ｒ Ｏ Ｎ Ｇ

0:05:17.120,0:05:18.480
There is only three loops.

0:05:18.480,0:05:20.180
One is this big one,

0:05:20.600,0:05:22.200
...one is this small one,

0:05:22.200,0:05:23.360
..and the other one is this one.

0:05:23.360,0:05:26.020
Now, we have to start adding voltages in loops

0:05:26.020,0:05:28.320
...along one direction in a loop.

0:05:28.320,0:05:30.960
It doesn't matter which direction
you move through the loop.

0:05:30.960,0:05:33.520
It can be clockwise or counterclockwise.

0:05:33.520,0:05:34.520
But for fun,

0:05:34.520,0:05:36.580
...let's keep them all clockwise.

0:05:36.580,0:05:37.980
Now, moving through a loop,

0:05:37.980,0:05:40.720
...if you enter the positive (+) terminal of a component,

0:05:40.720,0:05:42.460
...write a positive (above zero) voltage for it.

0:05:42.460,0:05:44.580
And if you enter a negative (-) terminal,

0:05:44.580,0:05:46.320
...write a negative (below zero) voltage for it.

0:05:46.320,0:05:47.360
Like here,

0:05:47.360,0:05:48.180
...we enter:

0:05:48.180,0:05:50.240
negative (-) V1

0:05:50.940,0:05:53.120
minus (-) V2

0:05:53.780,0:05:55.600
plus (+) V3

0:05:55.600,0:05:56.880
is equal to (=) zero (0)

0:05:57.020,0:05:59.680
And make sure you write ALL the voltages in that loop.

0:05:59.680,0:06:01.160
In the next one we have

0:06:01.160,0:06:03.140
minus (-) V3

0:06:03.140,0:06:05.640
minus (-) V4

0:06:05.640,0:06:07.180
minus (-) V5

0:06:07.180,0:06:07.860
is (=) zero (0)

0:06:07.860,0:06:09.040
And in the big loop, we have:

0:06:09.040,0:06:10.640
minus (-) V1

0:06:10.640,0:06:12.600
minus (-) V2

0:06:12.600,0:06:15.260
minus (-) V4

0:06:15.260,0:06:16.700
minus (-) V5

0:06:16.700,0:06:17.420
is (=) zero (0)

0:06:17.420,0:06:19.380
And of course, if you move the other way in the loop

0:06:19.380,0:06:21.040
All these voltages will be positive,

0:06:21.040,0:06:22.060
...which is the same thing.

0:06:22.060,0:06:24.260
And you have 3 equations just like that!

0:06:24.660,0:06:26.120
Of course, these are not unique.

0:06:26.120,0:06:27.440
And from any two of them (first 2 equations),

0:06:27.440,0:06:28.840
...you can get the third one (3rd equation),

0:06:28.840,0:06:30.240
...because, for example here,

0:06:30.240,0:06:32.500
...two small loops make one big loop.

0:06:32.680,0:06:34.320
So, two of them are enough.

0:06:34.320,0:06:36.700
And always go with the smallest one for ease.

0:06:36.700,0:06:37.740
Or, for example,

0:06:37.740,0:06:39.160
...if you have a circuit like this

0:06:39.160,0:06:41.080
...and write KVL for the first one,

0:06:41.080,0:06:41.580
...you have

0:06:41.580,0:06:42.960
minus (-) V1

0:06:42.960,0:06:44.160
plus (+) V2

0:06:44.160,0:06:45.200
is equal to (=) zero (0).

0:06:45.200,0:06:47.400
or: V1 is equal to (=) V2

0:06:47.680,0:06:49.200
Similarly, in the second one,

0:06:49.200,0:06:50.960
V2 is equal to (=) V3

0:06:50.960,0:06:51.580
...which means

0:06:51.580,0:06:54.520
V1 is equal to (=) V2 is equal to (=) V3.

0:06:54.700,0:06:55.880
This is fantastic!

0:06:55.880,0:06:59.080
It means that the voltage across all parallel components

0:06:59.080,0:07:00.580
...is always equal!

0:07:00.600,0:07:01.680
Remember this!

0:07:01.680,0:07:03.840
So that's what you get from KVL.

0:07:03.840,0:07:06.140
But those equations are often not enough

0:07:06.140,0:07:08.220
...to solve the voltage and current values.

0:07:08.220,0:07:09.880
And that's when you need:

0:07:11.380,0:07:12.800
According to KCL (Kirchhoff's Current Law),

0:07:12.800,0:07:14.940
...if you have a bunch of circuit branches

0:07:14.940,0:07:16.440
...connecting in one node (point),

0:07:16.440,0:07:19.060
...the sum of all currents (𝙸) going into the node

0:07:19.060,0:07:22.120
...is equal to the sum of all currents (𝙸) going out.

0:07:22.120,0:07:23.680
Otherwise, it would mean that

0:07:23.680,0:07:26.080
...charges are accumulating in the node,

0:07:26.080,0:07:27.400
...which is impossible.

0:07:27.400,0:07:29.460
Minding the lumped model again.

0:07:29.660,0:07:32.000
Stay tuned for more clarification!

0:07:32.400,0:07:33.620
It makes sense, doesn't it?

0:07:33.620,0:07:34.420
It is like:

0:07:34.420,0:07:36.300
If there is no leakage current,

0:07:36.300,0:07:38.900
...then all the water that goes into a pipe

0:07:38.900,0:07:40.560
...must go out of the other side,

0:07:40.560,0:07:42.940
...otherwise the pipe could bulge and explode.

0:07:43.540,0:07:45.620
And as we have defined that

0:07:45.620,0:07:49.120
...current (𝙸) is positive in the direction of the arrows.

0:07:49.120,0:07:52.960
Again, it doesn't matter if you know
the actual direction of the current.

0:07:52.960,0:07:54.720
You can assign them randomly.

0:07:54.720,0:07:55.840
For all I care,

0:07:55.840,0:07:58.020
...all these can point into the node,

0:07:58.020,0:07:59.340
...which would just mean that

0:07:59.340,0:08:02.060
...some of these currents (𝙸)
would have negative (-) values

0:08:02.060,0:08:04.520
...or the sum of all these currents (𝙸) would be zero (0).

0:08:04.660,0:08:05.860
So, based on KCL,

0:08:05.860,0:08:09.220
...if you have nodes with only two components
(left and right) connecting to it,

0:08:09.220,0:08:10.800
...which means they are in series,

0:08:11.280,0:08:13.320
𝙸1 going into the node

0:08:13.320,0:08:15.920
...is equal to (=) 𝙸2 leaving the node.

0:08:15.920,0:08:16.876
...or here,

0:08:16.880,0:08:20.640
...the same 𝙸2 going in is equal to (=) 𝙸3 leaving.

0:08:20.640,0:08:22.240
This is fantastic too!

0:08:22.240,0:08:25.220
This means the current through all series components

0:08:25.220,0:08:26.480
...is always the same.

0:08:26.480,0:08:27.600
Remember this too!

0:08:27.600,0:08:28.620
Let's look at this circuit.

0:08:28.620,0:08:29.800
It has four nodes (points):

0:08:29.800,0:08:31.640
1, 2, 3 and 4.

0:08:31.640,0:08:33.780
But two of these nodes don't matter.

0:08:33.780,0:08:35.740
...because they put components in series,

0:08:35.740,0:08:36.760
...and we already know

0:08:36.760,0:08:38.920
...the current through all of them is equal.

0:08:39.180,0:08:41.980
So only these two nodes are important for our analysis.

0:08:42.240,0:08:43.380
So, in this node,

0:08:43.380,0:08:45.240
𝙸1 going into the node

0:08:45.240,0:08:48.960
is equal to (=) 𝙸2 plus (+) 𝙸3 leaving the node.

0:08:48.960,0:08:50.100
And in this node,

0:08:50.100,0:08:53.080
𝙸2 plus (+) 𝙸3 going into the node

0:08:53.080,0:08:55.840
is equal to (=) 𝙸1 leaving the node.

0:08:55.840,0:08:58.300
...which is the same as the first one
(reversed) and is not unique.

0:08:58.300,0:09:00.960
So here, we only have one useful equation.

0:09:00.960,0:09:03.120
And that's what KCL does for you.

0:09:03.120,0:09:05.840
Yeah, you can assign polarities and directions randomly.

0:09:05.840,0:09:07.960
But it helps to understand the circuit better

0:09:07.960,0:09:09.460
...if you assign them properly.

0:09:09.460,0:09:11.660
For example, start with your power supply.

0:09:11.660,0:09:13.380
If you already know the polarity,

0:09:13.380,0:09:14.140
...you put it on,

0:09:14.140,0:09:15.180
...otherwise-

0:09:15.180,0:09:16.640
For example, if it is AC,

0:09:16.640,0:09:18.300
...put positive (+) on the top side.

0:09:18.300,0:09:19.700
...then the direction of the current

0:09:19.700,0:09:22.280
...goes out of the positive (+) of the power supply

0:09:22.280,0:09:24.240
...and distributes through the load

0:09:24.240,0:09:26.700
...and splits in branches

0:09:26.700,0:09:28.520
...and returns to the supply.

0:09:28.520,0:09:29.940
And on the load side,

0:09:29.940,0:09:34.100
...the current enters the positive (+) terminal of the load.

0:09:34.100,0:09:37.580
So you can easily put polarities there.

0:09:37.580,0:09:38.940
This kind of assignment

0:09:38.940,0:09:41.320
...keeps your values positive (above 0) for DC,

0:09:41.320,0:09:42.820
...not so much for AC.

0:09:42.820,0:09:45.520
But using it will give you a better understanding

0:09:45.520,0:09:47.280
...of the flow of your circuit.

0:09:47.280,0:09:48.280
Very simple!

0:09:48.280,0:09:49.940
Now, you know lumped model,

0:09:49.940,0:09:50.560
...KVL,

0:09:50.560,0:09:51.820
...and KCL!

0:09:51.820,0:09:53.000
Let's do an example.

0:09:53.000,0:09:54.140
We have a circuit like this,

0:09:54.140,0:09:55.620
...with an 8-volt (8 V) power supply

0:09:55.620,0:09:57.800
...and a bunch of resistor values like this,

0:09:57.800,0:10:00.800
...and I've assigned polarities and directions, as you see.

0:10:00.800,0:10:02.940
Writing the KVL and KCL equation,

0:10:02.940,0:10:06.040
...we see in loop 1 we get this equation (1st equation)

0:10:06.040,0:10:08.580
...in loop 2 we get this equation (2nd equation)

0:10:08.580,0:10:10.980
...and in this node we get that equation (3rd equation).

0:10:11.120,0:10:13.480
7 variables and 3 equations.

0:10:13.480,0:10:14.300
Not enough!

0:10:14.300,0:10:14.680
BUT

0:10:14.680,0:10:17.960
...we already know the relation of
voltage and current in resistors,

0:10:17.960,0:10:22.040
...where if the current enters a
positive (+) terminal of a resistor...

0:10:22.420,0:10:24.220
...voltage (V) across the resistor is

0:10:24.220,0:10:26.660
resistance (R) times (×) current (𝙸)

0:10:26.660,0:10:27.740
And just like that,

0:10:27.740,0:10:29.440
...we get four more equations.

0:10:29.560,0:10:31.760
Now we just have to sit down and solve it

0:10:32.400,0:10:33.060
What?

0:10:33.060,0:10:34.780
Your math requires improvement?

0:10:34.800,0:10:35.300
Go to:

0:10:35.720,0:10:36.960
...and start learning math!

0:10:36.960,0:10:37.840
Click on the link!

0:10:37.840,0:10:39.200
Now, don't be intimidated

0:10:39.200,0:10:41.400
...by such a simple stupid circuit.

0:10:41.400,0:10:43.520
All you need is a little bit more information

0:10:43.520,0:10:45.480
...to be able to solve it even easier!

0:10:45.480,0:10:47.560
For example, I know these two are in series

0:10:47.560,0:10:49.280
...so their equivalent resistance is:

0:10:49.280,0:10:50.240
1 plus (+) 3

0:10:50.240,0:10:51.280
...or 4 ohms (4 Ω).

0:10:51.280,0:10:53.440
And this 4-ohm is parallel to that 4-ohm,

0:10:53.440,0:10:55.460
...so the equivalent resistance here is 2 ohms (2 Ω).

0:10:55.460,0:10:56.000
(Resistance in parallel: 1/R1 + 1/R2 + 1/R3)
...so the equivalent resistance here is 2 ohms (2 Ω).

0:10:56.000,0:10:57.840
...and that 2-ohm is series with this one

0:10:57.840,0:11:00.620
...so the equivalent resistance here is 4 ohms (4 Ω).

0:11:00.620,0:11:03.380
So this entire circuit is like an 8-volt (8 V) supply

0:11:03.380,0:11:05.220
...across a 4 ohm (4 Ω) resistor.

0:11:05.220,0:11:07.460
The current going out of the supply is:

0:11:07.460,0:11:09.160
8 volts (8 V) divided by (÷) 4 ohms (4 Ω)

0:11:09.160,0:11:10.060
or 2 amps (2 A)

0:11:10.060,0:11:11.400
As soon as we know 𝙸1,

0:11:11.400,0:11:13.560
V1 is 2 ohms (2 Ω) times (×) 𝙸1

0:11:13.560,0:11:14.460
or 4 volts (4 V)

0:11:14.460,0:11:16.960
Right there, from KVL in this loop, we know

0:11:16.960,0:11:19.440
V2 is equal to (=) 8 minus (-) V1

0:11:19.440,0:11:20.280
or 4 volts (4 V)

0:11:20.280,0:11:21.740
And easy as that, we know

0:11:21.740,0:11:24.220
𝙸2 is (=) V2 divided by (÷) 4 ohms (4 Ω)

0:11:24.220,0:11:25.220
or 1 amp (1 A)

0:11:25.220,0:11:26.880
And from KCL we know-

0:11:27.550,0:11:27.820
Eh.

0:11:27.820,0:11:29.000
We'll leave the rest to you.

0:11:29.000,0:11:32.320
That first bit about equivalent circuits was important.

0:11:32.320,0:11:35.060
I should just tell you how series and parallel stuff work.

0:11:35.060,0:11:35.880
But I won't,

0:11:35.880,0:11:38.320
...because we already have much information to digest!

0:11:38.320,0:11:41.200
I will make a video later about equivalent circuits,

0:11:41.200,0:11:44.420
...and that will help you simplify the circuits for analysis.

0:11:44.420,0:11:45.240
But for now,

0:11:45.240,0:11:47.060
...KVL and KCL are enough,

0:11:47.060,0:11:49.580
...as long as you have lumped model elements.

0:11:50.400,0:11:51.420
But what if you don't?

0:11:51.420,0:11:53.660
What if the stupid elements are real

0:11:53.660,0:11:55.740
...and leaked radiations around?!

0:11:55.740,0:11:57.020
Some people even argue

0:11:57.020,0:12:00.020
...KVL and KCL don't hold in such cases.

0:12:00.020,0:12:00.560
No.

0:12:00.800,0:12:02.380
Let me put your mind at ease.

0:12:02.600,0:12:04.240
KVL and KCL

0:12:04.240,0:12:05.740
...always hold true

0:12:05.740,0:12:08.480
...as long as you have your definitions straight.

0:12:08.480,0:12:11.740
But they only give you results
as accurate as your model.

0:12:11.740,0:12:14.140
So you have to know every single element

0:12:14.140,0:12:15.880
...that's affecting your circuit.

0:12:15.880,0:12:16.580
For example,

0:12:16.580,0:12:18.480
...imagine I have a loop like this.

0:12:18.480,0:12:20.680
An AC supply across a resistor.

0:12:20.680,0:12:22.700
I measure the voltage across the resistor,

0:12:22.700,0:12:24.640
...and it doesn't match the supply voltage.

0:12:24.640,0:12:25.000
Ｗｈａｔ

0:12:25.000,0:12:25.400
ｔｈｅ

0:12:25.400,0:12:25.880
ｈｅｌｌ

0:12:25.880,0:12:26.920
The reason might be

0:12:26.920,0:12:30.520
...another inductor radiating
magnetic fields through my loop,

0:12:30.520,0:12:31.720
...creating voltage.

0:12:31.720,0:12:32.880
So I must understand

0:12:32.880,0:12:35.020
...there is a missing element in my model

0:12:35.020,0:12:36.320
...that I didn't consider,

0:12:36.320,0:12:38.220
...and that's the loop inductance

0:12:38.220,0:12:40.740
...acting as a secondary of a transformer.

0:12:40.740,0:12:41.700
I put it in,

0:12:41.700,0:12:43.200
...and the KVL holds.

0:12:43.200,0:12:45.960
Like I battled it out in one of my old videos.

0:12:45.960,0:12:48.380
And imagine you have AC current going into a node

0:12:48.380,0:12:49.900
...and going out of the other side,

0:12:49.900,0:12:51.920
...and you expect both to be equal.

0:12:51.920,0:12:52.620
You measure,

0:12:52.620,0:12:53.720
...and they're not!

0:12:53.720,0:12:54.440
This means

0:12:54.440,0:12:57.300
...there must be a third current leaking out somewhere.

0:12:57.320,0:12:58.300
Ｂｕｔ  ｗｈｅｒｅ！？

0:12:58.300,0:13:00.900
Maybe your wire is running too close to ground,

0:13:00.900,0:13:04.720
...and that creates a stray parasitic capacitance

0:13:04.720,0:13:06.340
...between your node and ground

0:13:06.340,0:13:07.760
...that you didn't account for,

0:13:07.760,0:13:09.660
...and is sucking the current away.

0:13:09.760,0:13:12.560
So as long as your model is accurate,

0:13:12.560,0:13:14.880
...KVL and KCL are accurate.

0:13:14.880,0:13:17.500
And all this nasty [REDACTED] happens in AC,

0:13:17.500,0:13:19.500
...where you have the most radiation.

0:13:19.500,0:13:21.840
In DC you only have to worry about heat.

0:13:21.840,0:13:24.840
And that's pretty much DC changes so slow.

0:13:24.840,0:13:25.860
Now sometimes,

0:13:25.860,0:13:29.140
...these stray parasitic components are so many,

0:13:29.140,0:13:31.340
...you ignore the ones with negligible effect

0:13:31.340,0:13:34.900
...and only include the ones with
the largest effect in your model.

0:13:34.900,0:13:36.100
Which is fine.

0:13:36.100,0:13:38.300
In electronics or any engineering,

0:13:38.300,0:13:42.100
...we define an acceptable
inaccuracy for our application,

0:13:42.100,0:13:44.960
...and design our circuits to work with that tolerance.

0:13:44.960,0:13:46.800
So don't worry about things so much.

0:13:46.800,0:13:47.700
We will design.

0:13:47.700,0:13:48.200
Simple.

0:13:48.200,0:13:48.600
Stuff™.

𝙎𝙊𝙊𝙉.

0:13:49.780,0:13:51.480
It requires very simple math.

0:13:51.480,0:13:53.660
But if you're worried about your math level,

0:13:53.660,0:13:54.500
...go straight to:

0:13:56.820,0:13:58.020
There you can take

0:13:58.420,0:14:00.480
...mathematical fundamentals...

0:14:01.360,0:14:01.860
Hmm

0:14:02.320,0:14:03.840
These look quite fun.

0:14:05.120,0:14:07.440
...is filled with very well-made courses

0:14:07.440,0:14:09.580

0:14:09.580,0:14:12.440
...from basic algebra to quantum computing.

0:14:12.660,0:14:13.860
But most importantly,

0:14:13.860,0:14:15.560
...they made it super fun to learn

0:14:15.560,0:14:17.440
...with their interactive platform.

0:14:18.060,0:14:18.900
Are they me?

0:14:19.340,0:14:20.040
No, I'm not interactive.

0:14:20.040,0:14:20.540

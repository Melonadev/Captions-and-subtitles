Hi.

0:00:00.560,0:00:02.040
Melvin asked me on Twitter

0:00:02.040,0:00:03.840
...if it is possible to make a bracelet

0:00:03.840,0:00:07.340
...that removes the static electricity
from body and avoids shock.

0:00:08.020,0:00:09.140
Of course, there are these

0:00:09.140,0:00:12.960
...straps that ground the body
and remove static electricity.

0:00:12.960,0:00:15.580
But is it possible to make a cordless one?

0:00:16.300,0:00:18.100
And surely after I did a quick search,

0:00:18.100,0:00:22.040
...I found that there are these anti-static
cordless bracelets like these,

0:00:22.040,0:00:23.440
And my reaction was,

0:00:23.440,0:00:24.160
...well,

0:00:24.160,0:00:25.340
'These are scam!'

0:00:25.340,0:00:29.020
I mean, how can you remove static electricity
from your body without sending it any...

0:00:29.020,0:00:31.020
...in your back and put it in your pocket, you have to...

0:00:31.020,0:00:33.320
How do these things sell on the web?

0:00:33.320,0:00:35.100
...under those, people are having...

0:00:35.100,0:00:37.120
I mean, how does it work? It is not even...

0:00:37.640,0:00:40.640
See, every time your body picks up static electricity,

0:00:40.640,0:00:42.740
...say by walking with socks on the carpet,

0:00:42.740,0:00:44.360
The only way to get rid of them

0:00:44.360,0:00:46.780
...is to take them and put them somewhere else,

0:00:46.780,0:00:47.720
...like in the ground.

0:00:47.720,0:00:49.540
And that's what this wire does.

0:00:49.540,0:00:53.240
You can't just put those charges in a
container and keep them in your pocket!

0:00:53.540,0:00:54.840
Dave Jones from the channel

0:00:55.700,0:00:59.540
...which is a great electronics teardown,
review and debunk channel,

0:00:59.540,0:01:00.960
...has a great video about this

0:01:00.960,0:01:04.280
...and shows that these cordless bracelets are garbage.

0:01:04.280,0:01:07.440
Basically, they've showed the fake bracelet he got online

0:01:07.440,0:01:10.900
...contained only a single 1-M立 resistor in it:

0:01:11.000,0:01:11.820
"And..."

0:01:11.820,0:01:12.820
"That's it!"

0:01:13.120,0:01:14.000
"Wow."

0:01:14.000,0:01:15.160
What's the use of that?

0:01:15.160,0:01:19.220
Is holding a resistor in my hands supposed
to magically discharge my body?

0:01:19.220,0:01:23.280
It is very important to at least understand
the tools you want to use for your work

0:01:23.280,0:01:25.740
...and educate yourself and not get scammed.

0:01:25.740,0:01:28.160

Anyway,

0:01:47.660,0:01:50.200
...holding a 1-M立 resister does nothing.

0:01:50.200,0:01:53.560
Why even 1 M立 when you can hold a 0 立 screwdriver?

0:01:54.480,0:01:55.060
Hmm...

0:01:55.060,0:01:56.300
That gives me an idea.

0:01:56.300,0:01:58.520
I was wondering if it is possible at all

0:01:58.520,0:02:01.580
...to have a standalone bracelet
that would dissipate charges.

0:02:01.580,0:02:04.060
And one thing came to mind, which is one of those

0:02:04.060,0:02:06.780
...punk rock bracelets with a bunch of spikes on them.

0:02:06.780,0:02:08.100
You might already know that

0:02:08.100,0:02:11.680
...electric charges accumulate on
the sharp points in a conductor,

0:02:11.680,0:02:13.860
And so much charge in a tiny point

0:02:13.860,0:02:16.060
...results in them repelling each other hard

0:02:16.060,0:02:18.200
...and dissipate into the air and environment.

0:02:18.200,0:02:20.740
You can easily see this when I run my Tesla coil.

0:02:24.940,0:02:29.580
See, the charges go out only from the
tip of the needle and nowhere else!

0:02:30.080,0:02:33.620
So I thought with those punk bracelets
having so many metal spikes,

0:02:33.620,0:02:36.480
...they potentially dissipate charges into the air quicker

0:02:36.480,0:02:40.060
...and drop my body voltage and reduce
the risk of discharge and shock.

0:02:40.060,0:02:41.040
So here's the plan.

0:02:41.040,0:02:42.780
I'm gonna buy one of those bracelets,

0:02:42.780,0:02:43.680
And to test it,

0:02:43.680,0:02:46.240
...I'm going to charge myself using my Van de Graaff

0:02:46.240,0:02:48.880
...and see if those spikes have any effect at all.

0:02:49.920,0:02:51.740
Granville Street in downtown Vancouver

0:02:51.740,0:02:55.560
...is one of those streets you can
find some questionable stores in.

0:02:55.940,0:02:57.800
Hopefully I can find what I need there.

0:02:59.200,0:03:00.780
'Fantasy Factory', eh?

0:03:00.780,0:03:01.520
Let's check that-

0:03:01.520,0:03:03.280
Jeez, that was the wrong shop.

0:03:03.620,0:03:05.480
Let's check the 'Rock Shop'.

0:03:05.480,0:03:06.700
Hopefully this one has it.

0:03:07.000,0:03:08.760
This looks like the right store.

0:03:09.560,0:03:10.600
Oh, there we are.

0:03:11.840,0:03:14.360
Those are the kind of spikes I'm looking for,

0:03:14.800,0:03:15.920
...but in a wrist band.

0:03:15.920,0:03:17.020
That's- What is that?

0:03:17.200,0:03:18.460
A collar or something?

0:03:18.460,0:03:20.760
I bought these two for a total of $70.

0:03:21.160,0:03:23.520
That's a strange expense on my business card.

0:03:24.380,0:03:28.120
Well, I got this not-very-impressive
one-row-of-spikes bracelet,

0:03:28.120,0:03:29.880
...but it's the pointiest one they had,

0:03:29.880,0:03:32.980
And then I found this one which is much pointier.

0:03:32.980,0:03:34.080
It's called 'The Choker',

0:03:35.080,0:03:38.500
...and they both have metal exposed
on the back to touch my skin.

0:03:38.500,0:03:40.320
Okay, let's do it without the spikes first.

0:03:41.440,0:03:42.780
I put my legs up,

0:03:46.080,0:03:47.720
...charge my body a little bit,

0:03:48.060,0:03:49.220
...and then discharge.

0:03:52.240,0:03:53.480
That was painful.

0:03:53.960,0:03:54.460
Okay,

0:03:54.460,0:03:56.000
...let's do it with the spikes now.

0:03:56.000,0:03:57.680
Okay, this time with the bracelet.

0:04:01.340,0:04:01.840
One,

0:04:01.840,0:04:02.440
...two,

0:04:02.440,0:04:02.940
...three,

0:04:02.940,0:04:03.440
...four,

0:04:03.440,0:04:03.940
...five

0:04:03.940,0:04:04.980
...and discharge.

0:04:08.340,0:04:09.680
It's absolutely useless.

0:04:10.020,0:04:12.400
Well, maybe the dome is charging my body too quickly.

0:04:12.400,0:04:13.780
So let's do it more realistically.

0:04:13.780,0:04:14.900
I'm gonna touch the dome,

0:04:16.440,0:04:17.660
...charge my body first,

0:04:17.660,0:04:19.800
...and then let go and then touch the ground.

0:04:21.220,0:04:22.240
I hate surprises.

0:04:22.240,0:04:23.880
Okay without the bracelet.

0:04:23.880,0:04:24.860
Charging my body.

0:04:25.720,0:04:26.340
1,

0:04:26.340,0:04:27.000
...2,

0:04:27.000,0:04:27.520
...3,

0:04:27.520,0:04:28.040
...4,

0:04:28.040,0:04:28.540
...5,

0:04:28.540,0:04:29.400
...and discharge.

0:04:29.400,0:04:30.020
1,

0:04:30.020,0:04:30.540
...2,

0:04:30.540,0:04:31.060
...3,

0:04:31.060,0:04:31.640
...4,

0:04:31.640,0:04:32.140
...5.

0:04:32.780,0:04:34.460
And now with the bracelet.

0:04:35.840,0:04:36.460
1,

0:04:36.460,0:04:37.060
...2,

0:04:37.060,0:04:37.560
...3,

0:04:37.560,0:04:38.140
...4,

0:04:38.140,0:04:38.780
...5,

0:04:39.640,0:04:40.160
1,

0:04:40.160,0:04:40.740
...2,

0:04:40.740,0:04:41.340
...3,

0:04:41.340,0:04:41.860
...4,

0:04:41.860,0:04:42.360
...5.

0:04:43.740,0:04:44.480
Useless.

0:04:45.140,0:04:47.460
Maybe it's not making a good contact to my body

0:04:47.460,0:04:49.520
...due to my massive fur,

0:04:49.520,0:04:51.180
So I'm gonna use aluminum foil

0:04:51.180,0:04:55.140
...to make sure that sparks are in good
contact with each other and my body.

0:04:55.620,0:04:56.320
Here we go.

0:04:58.460,0:04:59.200
1,

0:04:59.200,0:04:59.800
...2,

0:04:59.800,0:05:00.380
...3,

0:05:00.380,0:05:00.920
...4,

0:05:00.920,0:05:01.540
...5,

0:05:01.540,0:05:02.360
And 1,

0:05:02.360,0:05:02.860
...2,

0:05:02.860,0:05:03.380
...3,

0:05:03.380,0:05:03.920
...4,

0:05:03.920,0:05:04.420
...5.

0:05:05.600,0:05:06.460
Useless!

0:05:08.060,0:05:08.740
F*** it.

0:05:09.020,0:05:10.500
Let's use 'The Choker'.

0:05:10.500,0:05:12.640
It's not gonna look good around your neck in the lab,

0:05:12.640,0:05:14.200
...so I'm gonna put it around my wrist

0:05:14.200,0:05:16.380
...with the foil around it for good contact.

0:05:16.380,0:05:18.200
If this doesn't do it, nothing will!

0:05:18.200,0:05:18.820
Here you go.

0:05:18.820,0:05:21.660
The super-duper anti-static bracelet!

0:05:25.480,0:05:25.980
Okay.

0:05:25.980,0:05:26.660
1,

0:05:26.660,0:05:27.240
...2,

0:05:27.240,0:05:27.880
...3,

0:05:27.880,0:05:28.440
...4,

0:05:28.440,0:05:28.960
...5.

0:05:29.440,0:05:30.260
And 1,

0:05:30.260,0:05:30.840
...2,

0:05:30.840,0:05:31.400
...3,

0:05:31.400,0:05:32.040
...4,

0:05:33.780,0:05:34.580
What the hell?

0:05:35.740,0:05:36.380
1,

0:05:36.380,0:05:37.040
...2,

0:05:37.040,0:05:37.540
...3,

0:05:37.540,0:05:38.140
...4,

0:05:38.140,0:05:38.740
...5,

0:05:39.340,0:05:39.980
1,

0:05:39.980,0:05:40.560
...2,

0:05:40.560,0:05:41.140
...3,

0:05:41.140,0:05:41.640
...4

0:05:43.780,0:05:45.320
Completely useless!

0:05:45.640,0:05:47.480
I really thought this would do it.

0:05:47.480,0:05:50.260
I really thought having spikes on your body should help,

0:05:50.260,0:05:52.140
...but maybe their effect is insignificant

0:05:52.140,0:05:55.700
...compared to how your body already
dissipates charges on its own.

0:05:55.700,0:05:58.340
Now let's put on the grounding strap

0:05:58.340,0:06:00.200
...and see how well that works.

0:06:04.000,0:06:04.620
1,

0:06:04.620,0:06:05.220
...2,

0:06:05.220,0:06:05.720
...3,

0:06:05.720,0:06:06.240
...4,

0:06:06.240,0:06:06.900
...5.

0:06:07.360,0:06:08.000
1,

0:06:08.000,0:06:08.500
...2,

0:06:08.500,0:06:09.080
...3

0:06:09.600,0:06:10.420
Nothing.

0:06:15.280,0:06:17.860
Even having my hand completely on the dome,

0:06:17.860,0:06:19.340
...I don't feel any discharge!

0:06:19.880,0:06:21.180
Now instead of this strap,

0:06:21.180,0:06:23.760
...I put my bare feet on the tiled ground.

0:06:30.700,0:06:31.200
See?

0:06:31.200,0:06:33.240
Even the non-conductive piles

0:06:33.240,0:06:35.500
...discharge better than those stupid spikes.

0:06:35.760,0:06:36.960
Well, you know what it means.

0:06:36.960,0:06:41.820
If these spikes can't discharge you faster
than your body's normal discharge rate,

0:06:41.820,0:06:44.960
...then there is nothing out there that
can discharge you cordlessly.

0:06:44.960,0:06:49.020
All those cordless anti-static
straps are just a pile of junk!

0:06:49.020,0:06:51.380
One note is that, even in the corded straps,

0:06:51.380,0:06:55.220
...there is a 1-M立 resistance
in series with the grounding wire.

You never want to directly connect your body to ground,

0:06:57.960,0:07:02.800
...because in case you accidentally touch
high voltage you can easily get electrocuted.

0:07:02.800,0:07:05.220
The 1 M立 limits the current and saves you

0:07:05.220,0:07:07.820
...while it's good enough to get rid of static charges.

0:07:07.820,0:07:11.340
So make sure you have a properly
grounded anti-static wristband,

0:07:11.340,0:07:13.520
...or risk killing your naked electronics.

0:07:13.660,0:07:16.300
And start learning new things at Skillshare!

0:07:16.300,0:07:18.020
And make sure to use the promo code.

0:07:18.020,0:07:20.360
Only the first 500 people to sign up

0:07:20.360,0:07:23.020
...get the two-month free access to all the courses

0:07:23.020,0:07:25.200
...so you don't have any excuse not to learn.

0:07:25.200,0:07:28.580
I personally like to pick up my
video-editing skills a notch

0:07:28.580,0:07:30.560
...because it's taking forever as is.

0:07:31.000,0:07:33.420
There is this course on Adobe Premiere

0:07:33.420,0:07:37.220
...and it seems the entire course
is less than three hours?

0:07:37.740,0:07:40.420
I can't take a lot of free courses in two months.

0:07:40.820,0:07:42.520
Am I allowed to use that promo code?

0:07:42.860,0:07:45.320
Ah, I'll just ask one of my cousins to sign up for me.

0:07:46.080,0:07:46.580
Oh

0:07:47.300,0:07:49.540
Get it before my cousins take all the spots.
